# Order of Mass

God bless you! :pray: *Order of Mass* is a simple web app that shows the full text of either Roman Catholic Order of Mass or Holy Rosary or lets you read whole Bible translations in different languages.

Main features:

 * Full lectionary (only for Sundays so far)
 * Extract readings from different Bible translations
