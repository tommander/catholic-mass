# Order of Mass

God bless you!

This is a simple static web app for a Roman Catholic Order of Mass in different languages with separate choice for labels and mass language.

This app is currently deployed on [mass.tommander.cz](https://mass.tommander.cz) and this deployment site should be just for <q>end-users</q>; if you need the content in your app or website, please fork or download this project's code instead, don't scrape it from that site. Thank you.

## Humble request

Currently you can choose from English, Czech and Tagalog, however, revision and extension of existing translations as well as new languages would be highly appreciated.

I'm neither a linguist/translator nor an educated theologist, however, I would like to offer a correct Order of Mass anyone can use to help as a dynamic and complete <q>missalette</q>.

Therefore I would be more than grateful for a help!

## Plan

 - More languages (probably German, Italian and Spanish would be great for now)
 - Include prayers (instead of "prayer" placeholders)
 - WCAG 2.1 (AA) and HTML/CSS verification

I'm also considering including readings directly using self-hosted [Open Bibles](https://github.com/seven1m/open-bibles). It would however need more Bible translations. It also needs some machine-readable [lectionary](https://catholic-resources.org/Lectionary/), however, I'm not sure, how many different versions of lectionary there is, so along with all the possible Bible translatons, copyrights, manual work etc. it might be a big big task. So this is will most probably be started only after all the above points are done.
