# Order of Mass

God bless you!

This is a simple web app that you can use to follow Roman Catholic Order of Mass or Holy Rosary.

Features:

 * Separate language choice for web (labels) and mass
 * Switch between Order of Mass and Holy Rosary
 * Full lectionary (for Sundays, that is)
 * Extract readings from different Bible translations

This app is currently deployed on [mass.tommander.cz](https://mass.tommander.cz) and this deployment site should be just for <q>end-users</q>; if you need the content in your app or website, please fork or download this project's code instead, don't scrape it from that site. Thank you.

## Contribution

These days things change almost every day. Later, when the basics are finished, everything will be tracked in issue tracker, so it will be easier to see, what is being worked on (by me or anyone else).

Nevertheless, it's a long way to make this app really useful, so if you have time, I'd be super thankful for basically any help, because every aspect of this app needs some revision, testing, improvement etc. To name some:

 * Testing - reporting of errors, finding UX/UI/accessibility issues etc.
 * Translations - correction of existing ones, new translations
 * Correction and auditing of lectionary, Bible verse reference parsing
 * Code checking and security audit

Feel free to use PRs, issue tracking or reach out to me directly.

To get familiar with what this mess of a repo is about, the [Wiki]() should be a good starting point.

## Donation

No need to donate to me. There is a lot of people, who need help (and not only financial). I'd be more than grateful if you help those who need it the most.

And please do not forget to spread the good news :)

## Plan

 - Source code cleaning, beautifying, error fixing
 - Soon
   - Finish code documentation + Wiki
   - On smaller displays, tabs will be shown (probably) as a combobox
   - Automatic selection of options, if they are date-based
   - WCAG 2.1 (AA) and HTML/CSS verification
 - Later
   - More languages (probably German, Italian and Spanish would be great for now)
   - More Bible translations
   - Include prayers (instead of "prayer" placeholders) and missing parts of mass
