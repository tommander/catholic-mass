# Order of Mass

This is a simple static web app for a roman-catholic Order of Mass in different languages with separate choice for labels and mass language.

You can use this app e.g. when you're learning a new language or traveling abroad.

This app is currently deployed on https://mass.tommander.cz. Feel free to use anytime you need.

## Humble request

Currently you can choose from English, Czech and Tagalog, however, revision and extension of existing translations as well as new languages would be highly appreciated.

I'm neither a linguist/translator nor an educated theologist, however, I would like to offer a correct Order of Mass anyone can use to help as a dynamic and complete missalette.

Therefore I would be more than grateful for a help!
