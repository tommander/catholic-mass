# Order of Mass

God bless you! :pray: *Order of Mass* is a simple web app that shows the full text of either Roman Catholic Order of Mass or Holy Rosary or lets you read whole Bible translations in different languages.

Main features:

 * Separate language choice for web (labels) and mass
 * Switch between Order of Mass, Holy Rosary and Bible reading
 * Full lectionary (only for Sundays so far)
 * Extract readings from different Bible translations
 * Mobile and desktop friendly design
 * Secure feedback form

This app is currently deployed on [mass.tommander.cz](https://mass.tommander.cz). If you need some content in your app or website, please fork or download this project's code instead, don't scrape it from that site.

## Get Started

All necessary information should be available on [Wiki](https://github.com/tommander/catholic-mass/wiki/) (grouped by users, translators and developers).

## Contribution

I'd be super thankful for basically any help, because every aspect of this app needs some revision, testing, improvement etc. To name some:

 * Testing - reporting of errors, finding UX/UI/accessibility issues etc.
 * Translations - correction of existing ones, new translations
 * Correction and auditing of lectionary, Bible verse reference parsing
 * Code checking and security audit

Feel free to use PRs, issue tracking or reach out to me directly.

To get familiar with what this mess of a repo is about, the [Wiki](https://github.com/tommander/catholic-mass/wiki) should be a good starting point.

## Donation

No need to donate to me. There is a lot of people, who need help (not only financial). I'd be more than grateful if you help those who need it the most.

And please do not forget to spread the good news :pray:
