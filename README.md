# Order of Mass

God bless you!

This is a simple web app that you can use to follow Roman Catholic Order of Mass or Holy Rosary.

Features:

 * Separate language choice for web (labels) and mass
 * Switch between mass and rosary text
 * Full lectionary (for Sundays, that is)
 * Extract readings from different Bible translations

This app is currently deployed on [mass.tommander.cz](https://mass.tommander.cz) and this deployment site should be just for <q>end-users</q>; if you need the content in your app or website, please fork or download this project's code instead, don't scrape it from that site. Thank you.

## Contribution

These days I'm sending a lot of commits, so things change almost every day. Later, when the basics are finished, everything will be tracked in issue tracker, so it will be easier to see, what is being worked on (by me or anyone else).

Nevertheless, it's a long way to make this app really useful, so if you have time, I'd be super thankful for:

 * Testing - reporting of errors, finding UX/UI/accessibility issues etc.
 * Translations - correction of existing ones, new translations
 * Correction and auditing of lectionary, Bible verse reference parsing
 * Code checking and audit
 * Etc.

Feel free to use PRs, issue tracking or reach out to me directly.

## Donation

No need to donate to me.

There is a lot of people, who need help (and not only financial). I'd be more than grateful if you help those who need it the most.

And please do not forget to spread the good news :)

## Documentation

Beware, the documentation might not yet be complete or include some changes in the existing classes.

## Plan

 - Soon
  - Source code cleaning, beautifying, error fixing
  - Finish code documentation
  - Parse verse reference sentences (e.g. `Ps 1:1a`)
  - WCAG 2.1 (AA) and HTML/CSS verification
 - Later
  - More languages (probably German, Italian and Spanish would be great for now)
  - More Bible translations
  - Include prayers (instead of "prayer" placeholders)
  - Options (e.g. creeds) will not be displayed horizontally, but they will be selectable via combobox
