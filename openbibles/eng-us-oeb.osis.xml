<!-- s --><title>Naomi and Ruth</title>
<p>
<verse sID="Ruth.1.1" osisID="Ruth.1.1" n="1" />In the time when the judges ruled, there was once a famine in the land. A man from Bethlehem in Judah took his wife and two sons to live in the territory of Moab.
<verse eID="Ruth.1.1" />
<verse sID="Ruth.1.2" osisID="Ruth.1.2" n="2" />His name was Elimelech and his wife’s was Naomi, and his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion. They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah. After they had been living in Moab for some time,
<verse eID="Ruth.1.2" />
<verse sID="Ruth.1.3" osisID="Ruth.1.3" n="3" />Elimelech died, and Naomi was left with her two sons,
<verse eID="Ruth.1.3" />
<verse sID="Ruth.1.4" osisID="Ruth.1.4" n="4" />who married Moabite women named Orpah and Ruth. After they had lived there about ten years,
<verse eID="Ruth.1.4" />
<verse sID="Ruth.1.5" osisID="Ruth.1.5" n="5" />Mahlon and Chilion both died, and Naomi was left alone, without husband or sons.
<verse eID="Ruth.1.5" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Ruth.1.6" osisID="Ruth.1.6" n="6" />So she set out with her daughters-in-law to return from the land of Moab, for she had heard that the <divineName>Lord</divineName> had remembered his people and given them food.
<verse eID="Ruth.1.6" />
<verse sID="Ruth.1.7" osisID="Ruth.1.7" n="7" />As they were setting out together on the journey to Judah,
<verse eID="Ruth.1.7" />
<verse sID="Ruth.1.8" osisID="Ruth.1.8" n="8" />Naomi said to her daughters-in-law, “Go, return both of you to the home of your mother. May the <divineName>Lord</divineName> be kind to you as you have been kind to the dead and to me.
<verse eID="Ruth.1.8" />
<verse sID="Ruth.1.9" osisID="Ruth.1.9" n="9" />The <divineName>Lord</divineName> grant that each of you may find peace and happiness in the house of a new husband.”
</p>
<p>
Then she kissed them; but they began to weep aloud
<verse eID="Ruth.1.9" />
<verse sID="Ruth.1.10" osisID="Ruth.1.10" n="10" />and said to her, “No, we will return with you to your people.”
<verse eID="Ruth.1.10" />
<verse sID="Ruth.1.11" osisID="Ruth.1.11" n="11" />But Naomi said, “Go back, my daughters. Why should you go with me? Can I still bear sons who might become your husbands?
<verse eID="Ruth.1.11" />
<verse sID="Ruth.1.12" osisID="Ruth.1.12" n="12" />Go back, my daughters, go your own way, because I am too old to have a husband. Even if I should say, ‘I have hope,’ even if I should have a husband tonight and should bear sons,
<verse eID="Ruth.1.12" />
<verse sID="Ruth.1.13" osisID="Ruth.1.13" n="13" />would you wait for them until they were grown up? Would you remain single for them? No, my daughters! My heart grieves for you, for the <divineName>Lord</divineName> has sent me adversity.”
<verse eID="Ruth.1.13" />
<verse sID="Ruth.1.14" osisID="Ruth.1.14" n="14" />Then they again wept aloud, and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law goodbye, but Ruth stayed with her.
<verse eID="Ruth.1.14" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Ruth.1.15" osisID="Ruth.1.15" n="15" />“Look,” said Naomi, “your sister-in-law is going back to her own people and to her own gods. Go along with her!”
<verse eID="Ruth.1.15" />
<verse sID="Ruth.1.16" osisID="Ruth.1.16" n="16" />But Ruth answered, “Do not urge me to leave you or to go back. I will go where you go, and I will stay wherever you stay. Your people will be my people, and your God my God;
<verse eID="Ruth.1.16" />
<verse sID="Ruth.1.17" osisID="Ruth.1.17" n="17" />I will die where you die, and be buried there. May the <divineName>Lord</divineName> bring a curse upon me, if anything but death separate you and me.”
<verse eID="Ruth.1.17" />
<verse sID="Ruth.1.18" osisID="Ruth.1.18" n="18" />When Naomi saw that Ruth was determined to go with her, she ceased urging her to return.
<verse eID="Ruth.1.18" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Ruth.1.19" osisID="Ruth.1.19" n="19" />So they journeyed on until they came to Bethlehem. Their arrival stirred the whole town, and the women said, “Can this be Naomi?”
<verse eID="Ruth.1.19" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Ruth.1.20" osisID="Ruth.1.20" n="20" />“Do not call me Naomi,” she said to them, “call me Mara<note placement="foot"><reference type="annotateRef">1:20 </reference>In Hebrew “Naomi” means “pleasant,” and “Mara” means “bitter.”</note>, for the Almighty has given me a bitter lot.
<verse eID="Ruth.1.20" />
<verse sID="Ruth.1.21" osisID="Ruth.1.21" n="21" />I had plenty when I left, but the <divineName>Lord</divineName> has brought me back empty handed. Why should you call me Naomi, now that the <divineName>Lord</divineName> has afflicted me, and the Almighty has brought misfortune on me?”
<verse eID="Ruth.1.21" />
<verse sID="Ruth.1.22" osisID="Ruth.1.22" n="22" />So Naomi and Ruth, her Moabite daughter-in-law, returned from Moab. They reached Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest.
<verse eID="Ruth.1.22" />
<chapter eID="Ruth.1" />
<chapter sID="Ruth.2" osisID="Ruth.2" n="2" />
</p>
<!-- s --><title>In the Fields of Boaz</title>
<p>
<verse sID="Ruth.2.1" osisID="Ruth.2.1" n="1" />Now Naomi was related through her husband to a very wealthy man of the family of Elimelech named Boaz.
<verse eID="Ruth.2.1" />
<verse sID="Ruth.2.2" osisID="Ruth.2.2" n="2" />Ruth the Moabite said to Naomi, “Let me now go into the fields and gather leftover grain behind anyone who will allow me.”
</p>
<p>
“Go, my daughter,” she replied.
<verse eID="Ruth.2.2" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Ruth.2.3" osisID="Ruth.2.3" n="3" />So she went to glean in the field after the reapers. As it happened, she was in that part of the field which belonged to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.
<verse eID="Ruth.2.3" />
<verse sID="Ruth.2.4" osisID="Ruth.2.4" n="4" />When Boaz came from Bethlehem and said to the reapers, “The <divineName>Lord</divineName> be with you,” they answered him, “May the <divineName>Lord</divineName> bless you.”
<verse eID="Ruth.2.4" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Ruth.2.5" osisID="Ruth.2.5" n="5" />“Whose girl is this?” Boaz asked his servant who had charge of the reapers.
<verse eID="Ruth.2.5" />
<verse sID="Ruth.2.6" osisID="Ruth.2.6" n="6" />The servant who had charge of the reapers replied, “It is the Moabite girl who came back with Naomi from the territory of Moab.
<verse eID="Ruth.2.6" />
<verse sID="Ruth.2.7" osisID="Ruth.2.7" n="7" />She asked to be allowed to glean and gather sheaves after the reapers. So she came and has continued to work until now and she has not rested a moment in the field.”
<verse eID="Ruth.2.7" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Ruth.2.8" osisID="Ruth.2.8" n="8" />Then Boaz said to Ruth, “Listen, my daughter. Do not go to glean in another field nor leave this place, but stay here with my girls.
<verse eID="Ruth.2.8" />
<verse sID="Ruth.2.9" osisID="Ruth.2.9" n="9" />Watch where the men are reaping and follow the gleaners. I have told the young men not to trouble you. When you are thirsty, go to the jars and drink of that which the young men have drawn.”
<verse eID="Ruth.2.9" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Ruth.2.10" osisID="Ruth.2.10" n="10" />Then she bowed low and said to him, “Why are you so kind to me, to take interest in me when I am just a foreigner?”
<verse eID="Ruth.2.10" />
<verse sID="Ruth.2.11" osisID="Ruth.2.11" n="11" />Boaz replied, “I have heard what you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband, and how you left your father and mother and your native land to come to a people that you did not know before.
<verse eID="Ruth.2.11" />
<verse sID="Ruth.2.12" osisID="Ruth.2.12" n="12" />May the <divineName>Lord</divineName> repay you for what you have done, and may you be fully rewarded by the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge.”
<verse eID="Ruth.2.12" />
<verse sID="Ruth.2.13" osisID="Ruth.2.13" n="13" />Then she said, “I trust I may please you, my lord, for you have comforted me and spoken kindly to your servant, although I am not really equal to one of your own servants.”
<verse eID="Ruth.2.13" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Ruth.2.14" osisID="Ruth.2.14" n="14" />At mealtime Boaz said to Ruth, “Come here and eat some of the food and dip your piece of bread in the vinegar.” So she sat beside the reapers, and he passed her some roasted grain. She ate until she was satisfied and had some left.
<verse eID="Ruth.2.14" />
<verse sID="Ruth.2.15" osisID="Ruth.2.15" n="15" />When she rose to glean, Boaz gave this order to his young men: “Let her glean even among the sheaves and do not disturb her.
<verse eID="Ruth.2.15" />
<verse sID="Ruth.2.16" osisID="Ruth.2.16" n="16" />Also pull out some for her from the bundles and leave for her to glean, and do not find fault with her.”
<verse eID="Ruth.2.16" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Ruth.2.17" osisID="Ruth.2.17" n="17" />So she gleaned in the field until evening, then beat out what she had gleaned. It was about a bushel of barley.
<verse eID="Ruth.2.17" />
<verse sID="Ruth.2.18" osisID="Ruth.2.18" n="18" />Then she took it up and went into the town and showed her mother-in-law what she had gleaned. She also brought out and gave her that which she had left from her meal after she had had enough.
<verse eID="Ruth.2.18" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Ruth.2.19" osisID="Ruth.2.19" n="19" />“Where did you glean today, and where did you work?” asked her mother-in-law. “A blessing on him who took notice of you!”
</p>
<p>
So she told her mother-in-law where she had worked. “The name of the man with whom I worked today,” she said, “is Boaz.”
<verse eID="Ruth.2.19" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Ruth.2.20" osisID="Ruth.2.20" n="20" />Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, “May the blessing of the <divineName>Lord</divineName> rest on this man who has not ceased to show his loving-kindness to the living and to the dead. The man,” she added, “is a near relation of ours.”
<verse eID="Ruth.2.20" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Ruth.2.21" osisID="Ruth.2.21" n="21" />“He told me,” Ruth said, “that I must keep near his young men until they have completed all his harvest.”
<verse eID="Ruth.2.21" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Ruth.2.22" osisID="Ruth.2.22" n="22" />Naomi said to Ruth, “It is best, my daughter, that you should go out with his girls because you might not be as safe in another field.”
<verse eID="Ruth.2.22" />
<verse sID="Ruth.2.23" osisID="Ruth.2.23" n="23" />So she gleaned with the girls of Boaz until the end of the barley and wheat harvest; but she lived with her mother-in-law.
<verse eID="Ruth.2.23" />
<chapter eID="Ruth.2" />
<chapter sID="Ruth.3" osisID="Ruth.3" n="3" />
</p>
<!-- s --><title>Night and morning</title>
<p>
<verse sID="Ruth.3.1" osisID="Ruth.3.1" n="1" />One day, Naomi said to Ruth, “My daughter, should I not seek to secure a home for you where you will be happy and prosperous?
<verse eID="Ruth.3.1" />
<verse sID="Ruth.3.2" osisID="Ruth.3.2" n="2" />Is not Boaz, with whose girls you have been, a relative of ours?
<verse eID="Ruth.3.2" />
<verse sID="Ruth.3.3" osisID="Ruth.3.3" n="3" />Tonight he is going to winnow barley on the threshing-floor. So bathe and anoint yourself and put on your best clothes and go down to the threshing-floor. But do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking.
<verse eID="Ruth.3.3" />
<verse sID="Ruth.3.4" osisID="Ruth.3.4" n="4" />Then when he lies down, mark the place where he lies. Go in, uncover his feet, lie down, and then he will tell you what to do.”
<verse eID="Ruth.3.4" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Ruth.3.5" osisID="Ruth.3.5" n="5" />“I will do as you say.” Ruth said to her.
<verse eID="Ruth.3.5" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Ruth.3.6" osisID="Ruth.3.6" n="6" />So she went down to the threshing-floor and did just as her mother-in-law told her.
<verse eID="Ruth.3.6" />
<verse sID="Ruth.3.7" osisID="Ruth.3.7" n="7" />When Boaz had finished eating and drinking and was in a happy mood, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain. Then Ruth came quietly and uncovered his feet and lay down.
<verse eID="Ruth.3.7" />
<verse sID="Ruth.3.8" osisID="Ruth.3.8" n="8" />At midnight the man was startled and turned over, and there was a woman lying at his feet!
<verse eID="Ruth.3.8" />
<verse sID="Ruth.3.9" osisID="Ruth.3.9" n="9" />“Who are you?” he said. “I am Ruth your servant,” she answered, “Spread your cloak over your servant, for you are a near relative.”
<verse eID="Ruth.3.9" />
<verse sID="Ruth.3.10" osisID="Ruth.3.10" n="10" />He said, “May you be blest by the <divineName>Lord</divineName>, my daughter. You have shown me greater favor now than at first, for you have not followed young men, whether poor or rich.
<verse eID="Ruth.3.10" />
<verse sID="Ruth.3.11" osisID="Ruth.3.11" n="11" />My daughter, have no fear. I will do for you all that you ask, for the whole town knows that you are a virtuous woman.
<verse eID="Ruth.3.11" />
<verse sID="Ruth.3.12" osisID="Ruth.3.12" n="12" />Now it is true that I am a near relative, but there is another man nearer than I.
<verse eID="Ruth.3.12" />
<verse sID="Ruth.3.13" osisID="Ruth.3.13" n="13" />Stay here tonight, and then in the morning, if he will perform for you the duty of a kinsman, well, let him do it. But if he will not perform for you the duty of a kinsman, then as surely as the <divineName>Lord</divineName> lives, I will do it for you. Lie down until morning.”
<verse eID="Ruth.3.13" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Ruth.3.14" osisID="Ruth.3.14" n="14" />So she lay at his feet until morning, but rose before anyone could recognize her, for Boaz said, “No one must know that a woman came to the threshing-floor.”
<verse eID="Ruth.3.14" />
<verse sID="Ruth.3.15" osisID="Ruth.3.15" n="15" />He also said, “Bring the cloak which you have on and hold it.” So she held it while he poured into it six measures of barley and laid it on her shoulders. Then he went into the city.
<verse eID="Ruth.3.15" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Ruth.3.16" osisID="Ruth.3.16" n="16" />When Ruth came to her mother-in-law, Naomi asked, “Is it you, my daughter?” Then Ruth told Naomi all that the man had done for her.
<verse eID="Ruth.3.16" />
<verse sID="Ruth.3.17" osisID="Ruth.3.17" n="17" />“He gave me these six measures of barley,” she said, “for he said I should not go to my mother-in-law empty-handed.”
<verse eID="Ruth.3.17" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Ruth.3.18" osisID="Ruth.3.18" n="18" />“Wait quietly, my daughter.” Naomi said, “Until you know how the affair will turn out, for the man will not rest unless he settles it all today.”
<verse eID="Ruth.3.18" />
<chapter eID="Ruth.3" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Ruth.4" osisID="Ruth.4" n="4" />
<verse sID="Ruth.4.1" osisID="Ruth.4.1" n="1" />Then Boaz went up to the gate and sat down. Just then the near kinsman of whom Boaz had spoken came along. Boaz said, “Hello, So-and-so (calling him by name), come here and sit down.” So he stopped and sat down.
<verse eID="Ruth.4.1" />
<verse sID="Ruth.4.2" osisID="Ruth.4.2" n="2" />Boaz also took ten of the town elders and said, “Sit down here.” So they sat down.
<verse eID="Ruth.4.2" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Ruth.4.3" osisID="Ruth.4.3" n="3" />Then he said to the near relative, “Naomi, who has come back from the country of Moab, is offering for sale the piece of land which belonged to our relative Elimelech,
<verse eID="Ruth.4.3" />
<verse sID="Ruth.4.4" osisID="Ruth.4.4" n="4" />and I thought that I would lay the matter before you, suggesting that you buy it in the presence of these men who sit here and of the elders of my people. If you will buy it and so keep it in the possession of the family, do so; but if not; then tell me, so that I may know; for no one but you has the right to buy it, and I am next to you.”
</p>
<p>
“I will buy it,” he said.
<verse eID="Ruth.4.4" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Ruth.4.5" osisID="Ruth.4.5" n="5" />Then Boaz said, “On the day you buy the field from Naomi, you must also marry Ruth the Moabite, the widow of the dead, in order to preserve the name of the dead in connection with his inheritance.”
<verse eID="Ruth.4.5" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Ruth.4.6" osisID="Ruth.4.6" n="6" />“I cannot buy it for myself without spoiling my own inheritance,” the near relative said. “You take my right of buying it as a relative, because I cannot do so.”
<verse eID="Ruth.4.6" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Ruth.4.7" osisID="Ruth.4.7" n="7" />Now this used to be the custom in Israel: to make valid anything relating to a matter of redemption or exchange, a man drew off his sandal and gave it to the other man; and this was the way contracts were attested in Israel.
<verse eID="Ruth.4.7" />
<verse sID="Ruth.4.8" osisID="Ruth.4.8" n="8" />So when the near relative said to Boaz, “Buy it for yourself,” Boaz drew off the man’s sandal.
<verse eID="Ruth.4.8" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Ruth.4.9" osisID="Ruth.4.9" n="9" />Then Boaz said to the elders and to all the people, “You are witnesses at this time that I have bought all that was Elimelech’s and all that was Chilion’s and Mahlon’s from Naomi.
<verse eID="Ruth.4.9" />
<verse sID="Ruth.4.10" osisID="Ruth.4.10" n="10" />Moreover I have secured Ruth the Moabite, the wife of Mahlon, to be my wife, in order to perpetuate the name of the dead in connection with his inheritance, so that his name will not disappear from among his relatives and from the household where he lived. You are witnesses this day.”
<verse eID="Ruth.4.10" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Ruth.4.11" osisID="Ruth.4.11" n="11" />Then all the people who were at the gate and the elders said, “We are witnesses. May the <divineName>Lord</divineName> make the woman who is coming into your house like Rachel and Leah, who together built the house of Israel. May you do well in Ephrata, and become famous in Bethlehem.
<verse eID="Ruth.4.11" />
<verse sID="Ruth.4.12" osisID="Ruth.4.12" n="12" />From the children whom the <divineName>Lord</divineName> will give you by this young woman may your household become like the household of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah.”
<verse eID="Ruth.4.12" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Ruth.4.13" osisID="Ruth.4.13" n="13" />So Boaz married Ruth, and she became his wife; and the <divineName>Lord</divineName> gave to her a son.
<verse eID="Ruth.4.13" />
<verse sID="Ruth.4.14" osisID="Ruth.4.14" n="14" />Then the women said to Naomi, “Blessed be the <divineName>Lord</divineName> who has not left you at this time without a near relative, and may his name be famous in Israel.
<verse eID="Ruth.4.14" />
<verse sID="Ruth.4.15" osisID="Ruth.4.15" n="15" />This child will restore your vigor and nourish you in your old age; for your daughter-in-law who loves you, who is worth more to you than seven sons, has borne a son to Boaz!”
<verse eID="Ruth.4.15" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Ruth.4.16" osisID="Ruth.4.16" n="16" />So Naomi took the child in her arms and cared for him as if he was her own.
<verse eID="Ruth.4.16" />
<verse sID="Ruth.4.17" osisID="Ruth.4.17" n="17" />The women of the neighborhood gave him a name, saying, “A son is born to Naomi!” They named him Obed. He became the father of Jesse, who was the father of David.

<!-- s --><title>The Follies of a Despot</title>
<p>
<verse sID="Esth.1.1" osisID="Esth.1.1" n="1" />These events happened in the time of Ahasuerus, who ruled over a hundred and twenty-seven provinces from India to Ethiopia
<verse eID="Esth.1.1" />
<verse sID="Esth.1.2" osisID="Esth.1.2" n="2" />from his royal throne in the fortified palace of Susa.
<verse eID="Esth.1.2" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Esth.1.3" osisID="Esth.1.3" n="3" />In the third year of his reign, the king gave a feast for all his officers and courtiers. The commanders of the military forces of Persia and Media, the nobles and provincial rulers were present
<verse eID="Esth.1.3" />
<verse sID="Esth.1.4" osisID="Esth.1.4" n="4" />while for one hundred and eighty days he showed them the glorious riches of his kingdom and the costliness of his magnificent regalia.
<verse eID="Esth.1.4" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Esth.1.5" osisID="Esth.1.5" n="5" />When these days were ended, the king held a banquet for all the people who were present in the royal palace at Susa, high and low alike. It was a seven days’ feast in the enclosed garden of the royal palace.
<verse eID="Esth.1.5" />
<verse sID="Esth.1.6" osisID="Esth.1.6" n="6" />There were white and violet cotton curtains fastened to silver rings and pillars of marble with cords of fine purple wool and linen. The couches were of gold and silver placed upon a mosaic pavement of alabaster, white marble, mother-of-pearl, and dark stone.
<verse eID="Esth.1.6" />
<verse sID="Esth.1.7" osisID="Esth.1.7" n="7" />Drink was brought in vessels of gold – which were all different – and the king’s wine was provided with royal liberality.
<verse eID="Esth.1.7" />
<verse sID="Esth.1.8" osisID="Esth.1.8" n="8" />The drinking was unrestricted, for the king had directed all the officers of his household to let each man do as he pleased.
<verse eID="Esth.1.8" />
<verse sID="Esth.1.9" osisID="Esth.1.9" n="9" />Queen Vashti also gave a feast for the women in the King Ahasuerus’ royal palace.
<verse eID="Esth.1.9" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Esth.1.10" osisID="Esth.1.10" n="10" />On the seventh day, when the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zathar and Carkas, his seven eunuch attendants
<verse eID="Esth.1.10" />
<verse sID="Esth.1.11" osisID="Esth.1.11" n="11" />to bring Queen Vashti before him with the royal diadem on her head, to show her beauty to the people and the officials, for she was very beautiful.
<verse eID="Esth.1.11" />
<verse sID="Esth.1.12" osisID="Esth.1.12" n="12" />But Queen Vashti refused to come as the king commanded through the eunuchs. Then the king became very angry and his fury burned within him.
<verse eID="Esth.1.12" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Esth.1.13" osisID="Esth.1.13" n="13" />The king turned to the wise men who knew the precedents, for it was his custom to confer with those wise in law.
<verse eID="Esth.1.13" />
<verse sID="Esth.1.14" osisID="Esth.1.14" n="14" />Those next to him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena and Memucan, seven officials of Persia and Media who had access to the king and were highest in the kingdom.
<verse eID="Esth.1.14" />
<verse sID="Esth.1.15" osisID="Esth.1.15" n="15" />“Queen Vashit”, the king said, “has failed to obey my royal command – the command of King Ahasuerus conveyed through the eunuchs! What does the law say should be done to her?”
<verse eID="Esth.1.15" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Esth.1.16" osisID="Esth.1.16" n="16" />Memucan replied before the king and the officials, “Queen Vashti has done wrong not only to the king but also to all the officials and to all the peoples in all of the king’s provinces.
<verse eID="Esth.1.16" />
<verse sID="Esth.1.17" osisID="Esth.1.17" n="17" />The refusal of the queen will be reported to all the women with the result that it will make them despise their husbands. They will say, ‘King Ahasuerus commanded Queen Vashti to be brought in before him, but she did not come!’
<verse eID="Esth.1.17" />
<verse sID="Esth.1.18" osisID="Esth.1.18" n="18" />This very day the ladies of Persia and Media who have heard of the refusal of the queen will tell it to all the king’s officials, and there will be contempt and strife!
<verse eID="Esth.1.18" />
<verse sID="Esth.1.19" osisID="Esth.1.19" n="19" />If it seems best to the king, let him send out a royal edict. Let it be written among the laws of Persia and Media, never to be repealed, that Vashti may never again come before King Ahasuerus. Let the king give her place as queen to another who is more worthy than she.
<verse eID="Esth.1.19" />
<verse sID="Esth.1.20" osisID="Esth.1.20" n="20" />When the king’s decree which he makes is heard throughout his kingdom – great as it is – the wives of all classes will give honor to their husbands.”
<verse eID="Esth.1.20" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Esth.1.21" osisID="Esth.1.21" n="21" />The proposal pleased the king and the officials, and the king did as Memucan advised.
<verse eID="Esth.1.21" />
<verse sID="Esth.1.22" osisID="Esth.1.22" n="22" />He sent letters to all the provinces, to every province in its own system of writing and to every people in their language, that every man should be master in his own house!
<verse eID="Esth.1.22" />
<chapter eID="Esth.1" />
<chapter sID="Esth.2" osisID="Esth.2" n="2" />
</p>
<!-- s --><title>Choosing a Queen</title>
<p>
<verse sID="Esth.2.1" osisID="Esth.2.1" n="1" />Some time later, when the wrath of King Ahasuerus had subsided, he remembered what Vashti had done and what had been decreed against her.
<verse eID="Esth.2.1" />
<verse sID="Esth.2.2" osisID="Esth.2.2" n="2" />Then the king’s servants who waited upon him said, “Let beautiful young virgins be sought for the king,
<verse eID="Esth.2.2" />
<verse sID="Esth.2.3" osisID="Esth.2.3" n="3" />and let the king appoint commissioners to all the provinces of his kingdom to gather them all to Susa the royal residence. Let them be brought into the women’s quarters under the custody of Hegai, the king’s eunuch, who has charge of the women. Then give them what is needed to make them beautiful,
<verse eID="Esth.2.3" />
<verse sID="Esth.2.4" osisID="Esth.2.4" n="4" />and let the girl who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti.” The proposal pleased the king so he put it into action.
<verse eID="Esth.2.4" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Esth.2.5" osisID="Esth.2.5" n="5" />In Susa the royal residence lived a Jew named Mordecai. He was son of Jair, son of Shimei, son of Kish, a Benjamite.
<verse eID="Esth.2.5" />
<verse sID="Esth.2.6" osisID="Esth.2.6" n="6" />(Kish had been carried away from Jerusalem with the exiles who were deported with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon took captive.)
<verse eID="Esth.2.6" />
<verse sID="Esth.2.7" osisID="Esth.2.7" n="7" />Mordecai had adopted Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle’s daughter, since she had neither father nor mother. The girl was shapely and beautiful; and after her father and mother died, Mordecai raised her as if she was his own daughter.
<verse eID="Esth.2.7" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Esth.2.8" osisID="Esth.2.8" n="8" />When the king’s command and decree were known, many girls were gathered together to Susa the capital under the custody of Hegai. Esther was also taken into the king’s palace and placed under the custody of Hegai, who had charge of the women.
<verse eID="Esth.2.8" />
<verse sID="Esth.2.9" osisID="Esth.2.9" n="9" />The girl pleased him and gained his favor, so that he quickly gave her the cosmetics she needed to enhance her beauty and her allowance of food and the seven maids selected from the king’s household. He also transferred her and her maids to the best place in the harem.
<verse eID="Esth.2.9" />
<verse sID="Esth.2.10" osisID="Esth.2.10" n="10" />Esther had not revealed her people nor her family background because Mordecai had ordered her not to.
<verse eID="Esth.2.10" />
<verse sID="Esth.2.11" osisID="Esth.2.11" n="11" />Every day Mordecai would to walk in front of the courtyard of the harem and ask after Esther’s health and what was happening to her.
<verse eID="Esth.2.11" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Esth.2.12" osisID="Esth.2.12" n="12" />The girls were prepared for meeting King Ahasuerus for twelve months: six months being treated with oil of myrrh and six months with perfumes and cosmetics. After the twelve months,
<verse eID="Esth.2.12" />
<verse sID="Esth.2.13" osisID="Esth.2.13" n="13" />each girl went in to the king. She was allowed to take with her whatever she wished from the women’s quarters,
<verse eID="Esth.2.13" />
<verse sID="Esth.2.14" osisID="Esth.2.14" n="14" />and would enter the palace in the evening and return the next morning to another part of the harem under the care of the king’s eunuch Shaashgaz who was in charge of concubines. She would not go to the king again unless he desired her and summoned her by name.
<verse eID="Esth.2.14" />
<verse sID="Esth.2.15" osisID="Esth.2.15" n="15" />When it was the turn of Esther (the girl adopted by Mordecai, daughter of his uncle Abihail) to go in to the king, she only took with her those things that Hegai, the king’s eunuch in charge of the women, had advised her to take. Esther was liked by all who saw her.
<verse eID="Esth.2.15" />
<verse sID="Esth.2.16" osisID="Esth.2.16" n="16" />Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus in the royal palace in the tenth month, the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.
<verse eID="Esth.2.16" />
<verse sID="Esth.2.17" osisID="Esth.2.17" n="17" />And the king loved her more than all the other women, and she became his favorite and won his affection. He placed the royal diadem on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti.
<verse eID="Esth.2.17" />
<verse sID="Esth.2.18" osisID="Esth.2.18" n="18" />Then the king gave a great feast to all his officials and courtiers in honor of Esther, and he remitted the taxes of the provinces and distributed gifts with royal liberality.
<verse eID="Esth.2.18" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Esth.2.19" osisID="Esth.2.19" n="19" />All the time the virgins were assembled again, Mordecai was sitting as an offical at the king’s gate.
<verse eID="Esth.2.19" />
<verse sID="Esth.2.20" osisID="Esth.2.20" n="20" />Esther had not revealed her people or family background because she still obeyed him as she had when he was bringing her up.

<!-- s --><title>Hatred without Pity</title>
<p>
<verse sID="Esth.2.21" osisID="Esth.2.21" n="21" />In those days while Mordecai was sitting in the king’s gate, two of the royal court attendants, Bigthan and Teresh, who guarded the entrance of the palace, became enraged and attempted to kill King Ahasuerus.
<verse eID="Esth.2.21" />
<verse sID="Esth.2.22" osisID="Esth.2.22" n="22" />But Mordecai learned of the conspiracy and disclosed it to Queen Esther, and she told the king on Mordecai’s behalf.
<verse eID="Esth.2.22" />
<verse sID="Esth.2.23" osisID="Esth.2.23" n="23" />When the affair was investigated and the facts discovered, the conspirators were both hanged on the gallows. The incident was recorded in the presence of the king in the daily record of events.
<verse eID="Esth.2.23" />

<p>
<chapter sID="Esth.3" osisID="Esth.3" n="3" />
<verse sID="Esth.3.1" osisID="Esth.3.1" n="1" />After these events King Ahasuerus promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him to a place above all the officials who were with him.
<verse eID="Esth.3.1" />
<verse sID="Esth.3.2" osisID="Esth.3.2" n="2" />All the king’s courtiers who were in the king’s gate used to bow down before Haman, for so the king had commanded, but Mordecai did not bow down nor prostrate himself.
<verse eID="Esth.3.2" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Esth.3.3" osisID="Esth.3.3" n="3" />Then the king’s courtiers, who were in the king’s gate, said to Mordecai, “Why do you disobey the king’s command?”
<verse eID="Esth.3.3" />
<verse sID="Esth.3.4" osisID="Esth.3.4" n="4" />When they had spoken to him day after day without his listening to them, they informed Haman, to see whether Mordecai’s acts would be tolerated, for he had told them that he was a Jew.
<verse eID="Esth.3.4" />
<verse sID="Esth.3.5" osisID="Esth.3.5" n="5" />When Haman saw that Mordecai did not bow down nor prostrate himself before him, he was furious.
<verse eID="Esth.3.5" />
<verse sID="Esth.3.6" osisID="Esth.3.6" n="6" />But it seemed to him beneath his dignity to lay hands on Mordecai alone, for they had told him who Mordecai’s people were. Instead Haman sought to destroy all the people of Mordecai, all the Jews throughout the kingdom of Ahasuerus.
<verse eID="Esth.3.6" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Esth.3.7" osisID="Esth.3.7" n="7" />In the first month (the month of Nisan) in the twelfth year of the reign of King Ahasuerus, Haman had ‘pur’ (which means ‘lot’) cast before him to determine the best day and best month for his actions. The lot fell on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month – the month of Adar.
<verse eID="Esth.3.7" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Esth.3.8" osisID="Esth.3.8" n="8" />So Haman said to King Ahasuerus, “There is a certain people scattered among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom, whose laws differ from those of every other and who do not keep the king’s laws. Therefore it is not right for the king to tolerate them.
<verse eID="Esth.3.8" />
<verse sID="Esth.3.9" osisID="Esth.3.9" n="9" />If it seems best to the king, let an order be given to destroy them, and I will pay ten thousand silver coins into the royal treasury.”
<verse eID="Esth.3.9" />
<verse sID="Esth.3.10" osisID="Esth.3.10" n="10" />So the king took off his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews.
<verse eID="Esth.3.10" />
<verse sID="Esth.3.11" osisID="Esth.3.11" n="11" />“The money is yours,” the king said to Haman, “and the people also to do with them as you wish.”
<verse eID="Esth.3.11" />
<verse sID="Esth.3.12" osisID="Esth.3.12" n="12" />And so, on the thirteenth day of the first month, the king’s secretaries were summoned and as Haman instructed an edict was issued to the king’s satraps and provincial governors and the rulers of each of the peoples in their own script and their own language. The edict was written in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed with his ring.
<verse eID="Esth.3.12" />
<verse sID="Esth.3.13" osisID="Esth.3.13" n="13" />Dispatches were sent by couriers to all the king’s provinces, saying: Destroy, kill, put an end to all the Jews, young and old, little children and women, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, and plunder their possessions.
<verse eID="Esth.3.13" />
<verse sID="Esth.3.14" osisID="Esth.3.14" n="14" />A copy of the edict was to be published as a decree in every province – publicly displayed so that everyone might be ready for that day.
<verse eID="Esth.3.14" />
<verse sID="Esth.3.15" osisID="Esth.3.15" n="15" />By command of the king the couriers raced off, and the edict was published in Susa itself.
</p>
<p>
Then the king and Haman sat down to drink, but the city of Susa was in turmoil.

<!-- s --><title>A Queen’s Efforts to Save Her People</title>
<p>
<verse sID="Esth.4.1" osisID="Esth.4.1" n="1" />When Mordecai learned all that had been done, he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and strewed ashes on his head, and went out into the city and raised a loud and bitter cry of lamentation.
<verse eID="Esth.4.1" />
<verse sID="Esth.4.2" osisID="Esth.4.2" n="2" />He went as far as the king’s gate, but no one could enter the gate clothed with sackcloth.
<verse eID="Esth.4.2" />
<verse sID="Esth.4.3" osisID="Esth.4.3" n="3" />In every province, wherever the king’s command and decree went, there was great mourning, fasting, weeping, and wailing among the Jews. Many of them sat in sackcloth and ashes.
<verse eID="Esth.4.3" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Esth.4.4" osisID="Esth.4.4" n="4" />When Esther’s maids and attendants told her about Mordecai’s behavior, she was greatly troubled. She sent garments for Mordecai to put on, so that he could take off his sack-cloth, but he would not accept them.
<verse eID="Esth.4.4" />
<verse sID="Esth.4.5" osisID="Esth.4.5" n="5" />So Esther called Hathach, one of the king’s eunuchs whom he had appointed to attend her, and ordered him to go to Mordecai to learn what it all meant and the reason for it.
<verse eID="Esth.4.5" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Esth.4.6" osisID="Esth.4.6" n="6" />So Hathach went out to Mordecai, to the city square in front of the king’s gate.
<verse eID="Esth.4.6" />
<verse sID="Esth.4.7" osisID="Esth.4.7" n="7" />Mordecai told him all that had happened to him and the exact amount of money that Haman had promised to pay into the king’s treasury for the destruction of the Jews.
<verse eID="Esth.4.7" />
<verse sID="Esth.4.8" osisID="Esth.4.8" n="8" />Also he gave him a copy of the decree to destroy them, that had been published in Susa, to show to Esther for her information. He also told her to go to the king and implore his mercy and to plead with him in behalf of her people.
<verse eID="Esth.4.8" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Esth.4.9" osisID="Esth.4.9" n="9" />When Hathach came and told Esther what Mordecai had said,
<verse eID="Esth.4.9" />
<verse sID="Esth.4.10" osisID="Esth.4.10" n="10" />she instructed Hathach to go and say to Mordecai,
<verse eID="Esth.4.10" />
<verse sID="Esth.4.11" osisID="Esth.4.11" n="11" />“All the king’s courtiers and the people of the king’s provinces know that for every man or woman who goes to the king into the inner court without being called there is one penalty, death, unless the king holds out the golden sceptre signifying that they may live. It has been thirty days since I have been called to go in to the king.”
<verse eID="Esth.4.11" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Esth.4.12" osisID="Esth.4.12" n="12" />When Mordecai was told what Esther had said,
<verse eID="Esth.4.12" />
<verse sID="Esth.4.13" osisID="Esth.4.13" n="13" />he sent back this reply to Esther, “Don’t imagine that you alone of all the Jews will escape because you belong to the king’s household.
<verse eID="Esth.4.13" />
<verse sID="Esth.4.14" osisID="Esth.4.14" n="14" />If you persist in remaining silent at this time, relief and deliverance will come to the Jews from another quarter, but you and your family will perish. Who knows? Maybe you have been raised to the throne for a time like this!”
<verse eID="Esth.4.14" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Esth.4.15" osisID="Esth.4.15" n="15" />Then Esther sent this message to Mordecai:
<verse eID="Esth.4.15" />
<verse sID="Esth.4.16" osisID="Esth.4.16" n="16" />“Go, gather all the Jews in Susa and fast for me. Don’t eat nor drink anything for three days and nights. My maids and I will fast as well. Then I will go in to the king, although it is contrary to the law, and if I die, I die.”
<verse eID="Esth.4.16" />
<verse sID="Esth.4.17" osisID="Esth.4.17" n="17" />Mordecai did everything Esther had directed.
<verse eID="Esth.4.17" />
<chapter eID="Esth.4" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Esth.5" osisID="Esth.5" n="5" />
<verse sID="Esth.5.1" osisID="Esth.5.1" n="1" />On the third day, Esther put on her regalia and stood in the inner court of the royal palace opposite the king’s house. The king was sitting on his throne in the palace, opposite the entrance.
<verse eID="Esth.5.1" />
<verse sID="Esth.5.2" osisID="Esth.5.2" n="2" />When he saw Esther the queen standing in the court, she won his favor, and he held out to her the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther approached and touched the top of the sceptre.
<verse eID="Esth.5.2" />
<verse sID="Esth.5.3" osisID="Esth.5.3" n="3" />Then the king said to her, “What is it, Queen Esther? Whatever your request is, it will be granted, even if it is the half of the kingdom.”
<verse eID="Esth.5.3" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Esth.5.4" osisID="Esth.5.4" n="4" />“If it seems best to the king,” Esther said, “let the king and Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him.”
<verse eID="Esth.5.4" />
<verse sID="Esth.5.5" osisID="Esth.5.5" n="5" />Then the king ordered, “Bring Haman quickly, so that Esther’s wish may be gratified.”
</p>
<p>
So the king and Haman went to the banquet that Esther had prepared.
<verse eID="Esth.5.5" />
<verse sID="Esth.5.6" osisID="Esth.5.6" n="6" />While they were drinking wine, the king said to Esther, “Whatever your petition is, it will be granted. Your request, it will be done – even if it takes half of my kingdom.”
<verse eID="Esth.5.6" />
<verse sID="Esth.5.7" osisID="Esth.5.7" n="7" />Esther answered,
<verse eID="Esth.5.7" />
<verse sID="Esth.5.8" osisID="Esth.5.8" n="8" />“If I have won the king’s favor and if it seems best to the king to grant my petition and to accede to my request, my petition and my request are that the king and Haman come to the banquet which I will prepare for them. Tomorrow I will answer the king’s question as he wishes.”
<verse eID="Esth.5.8" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Esth.5.9" osisID="Esth.5.9" n="9" />Haman went out that day joyful and elated, but when he saw Mordecai in the king’s gate and noticed that he neither stood up nor moved for him, he was furiously angry with Mordecai.
<verse eID="Esth.5.9" />
<verse sID="Esth.5.10" osisID="Esth.5.10" n="10" />Nevertheless Haman restrained himself and went home. He called together his friends and Zeresh his wife
<verse eID="Esth.5.10" />
<verse sID="Esth.5.11" osisID="Esth.5.11" n="11" />and recounted to them the greatness of his wealth, how many children he had, and all the ways in which the king had honored him, and how he had promoted him above the officials and the royal courtiers.
<verse eID="Esth.5.11" />
<verse sID="Esth.5.12" osisID="Esth.5.12" n="12" />“What is more,” Haman said, “Queen Esther brought no one in with the king to the banquet which she had prepared except me, and tomorrow also I am invited by her along with the king.
<verse eID="Esth.5.12" />
<verse sID="Esth.5.13" osisID="Esth.5.13" n="13" />Yet all this does not satisfy me as long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate.”

</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Esth.5.14" osisID="Esth.5.14" n="14" />Then Zeresh his wife and all his friends said to him, “Let a gallows seventy-five feet high be erected, and in the morning speak to the king and let Mordecai be hanged on it. Then go merrily with the king to the banquet.” The advice pleased Haman, and so he had the gallows erected.

<verse eID="Esth.6.1" />
<verse sID="Esth.6.2" osisID="Esth.6.2" n="2" />It was found recorded how Mordecai had furnished information regarding Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king’s attendants who guarded the entrance of the palace, who had attempted to kill King Ahasuerus.

<verse sID="Esth.6.3" osisID="Esth.6.3" n="3" />“What honor and dignity have been conferred on Mordecai for this?” the king asked. When the king’s pages who waited on him replied “Nothing has been done for him,”
<verse eID="Esth.6.3" />
<verse sID="Esth.6.4" osisID="Esth.6.4" n="4" />the king said, “Who is in the court?” Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the king’s house to speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.
<verse eID="Esth.6.4" />
<verse sID="Esth.6.5" osisID="Esth.6.5" n="5" />So the king’s pages said to him, “Haman is standing there, in the court.” The king said, “Let him enter.”
<verse eID="Esth.6.5" />
<verse sID="Esth.6.6" osisID="Esth.6.6" n="6" />So Haman entered, and the king said to him, “What should be done for the man whom the king wishes to honor?” Haman said to himself, “Whom besides me could the king wish to honor?”
<verse eID="Esth.6.6" />
<verse sID="Esth.6.7" osisID="Esth.6.7" n="7" />So he said to the king, “For the man whom the king wishes to honor
<verse eID="Esth.6.7" />
<verse sID="Esth.6.8" osisID="Esth.6.8" n="8" />let a royal garment be brought, which the king has worn, and the horse on which the king has ridden and on whose head a royal diadem has been placed.

<verse sID="Esth.6.9" osisID="Esth.6.9" n="9" />Then let the garment and the horse be placed in charge of one of the king’s noble officials.

<verse eID="Esth.6.9" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Esth.6.10" osisID="Esth.6.10" n="10" />Then the king said to Haman, “Make haste and take the garment and the horse, as you have said, and do this to Mordecai the Jew, who sits in the king’s gate. Omit nothing of all you have said.”
<verse eID="Esth.6.10" />
<verse sID="Esth.6.11" osisID="Esth.6.11" n="11" />So Haman took the garment and the horse and clothed Mordecai, and made him ride through the city square and proclaimed before him, “This is what is done for the man whom the king wishes to honor.”

As the king spoke these words, the attendants covered Haman’s face
<verse eID="Esth.7.8" />
<verse sID="Esth.7.9" osisID="Esth.7.9" n="9" />and Harbonah, one of those who waited on the king, said, “There are the gallows, seventy-five feet high, which Hainan erected for Mordecai, who spoke a good word in behalf of the king, standing in the house of Haman!” The king said “Hang him on them.”
<verse eID="Esth.7.9" />

<verse sID="Esth.8.3" osisID="Esth.8.3" n="3" />Then Esther sought another audience with the king and fell at his feet and with tears begged him to avert the evil planned by Haman the Agagite and to frustrate his designs against the Jews.
<verse eID="Esth.8.3" />
<verse sID="Esth.8.4" osisID="Esth.8.4" n="4" />The king held out to her the golden sceptre, and she arose and stood before him.
<verse eID="Esth.8.4" />
<verse sID="Esth.8.5" osisID="Esth.8.5" n="5" />“If it seems best to the king,” she said, “and if I have won his favor and he thinks it right, and if I please him, let written orders be given to revoke the dispatches devised by Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote ordering the destruction of the Jews who are in all the king’s provinces.
<verse eID="Esth.8.5" />
<verse sID="Esth.8.6" osisID="Esth.8.6" n="6" />For how can I bear to look upon the evil that will come to my people? How can I bear to see their destruction?”
<verse eID="Esth.8.6" />
<verse sID="Esth.8.7" osisID="Esth.8.7" n="7" />Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, “See, I have given Esther the property of Haman, and they have hanged him on the gallows, because he laid hands upon the Jews.
<verse eID="Esth.8.7" />
<verse sID="Esth.8.8" osisID="Esth.8.8" n="8" />Now you write on behalf of the Jews, as seems best to you, in the king’s name and seal it with the king’s signet ring. For a document that is written in the king’s name and sealed with the king’s signet ring cannot be revoked.”
<verse eID="Esth.8.8" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Esth.8.9" osisID="Esth.8.9" n="9" />On the twenty-third day of the third month (that is the month of Sivan), the king’s secretaries were summoned and as Mordecai instructed an edict was issued to the Jews, to the satraps and provincial governors and the rulers of each of the one hundred twenty-seven provinces from India to Ethiopia in their own script and their own language, and to the Jews in their own script and language.
<verse eID="Esth.8.9" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Esth.8.10" osisID="Esth.8.10" n="10" />Mordecai wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus. He sealed it with the king’s signet ring. Dispatches were sent by mounted couriers who rode the swift, noble steeds, bred of the royal studs.
<verse eID="Esth.8.10" />
<verse sID="Esth.8.11" osisID="Esth.8.11" n="11" />In this way the king permitted the Jews who were in every city to gather together and make a stand for their life, to destroy, to kill, and annihilate all the armed forces of any people or province that might be hostile to them, including their children and women, and to take their goods as plunder
<verse eID="Esth.8.11" />
<verse sID="Esth.8.12" osisID="Esth.8.12" n="12" />throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus on that thirteenth day of the twelfth month (which is called Adar).
<verse eID="Esth.8.12" />
<verse sID="Esth.8.13" osisID="Esth.8.13" n="13" />A copy of the edict was to be published as a decree in every province – publicly displayed so that the Jews might be ready for that day and avenge themselves.
<verse eID="Esth.8.13" />
<verse sID="Esth.8.14" osisID="Esth.8.14" n="14" />So the couriers who rode the swift, noble steeds went out, hastened and impelled by the king’s commands!
</p>
<p>
Meantime the decree had been given out in the royal palace at Susa;
<verse eID="Esth.8.14" />
<verse sID="Esth.8.15" osisID="Esth.8.15" n="15" />and Mordecai had gone out from the presence of the king in royal garments of violet and white and with a great crown of gold and with a robe of fine linen and purple. The people of Susa shouted and were glad.
<verse eID="Esth.8.15" />
<verse sID="Esth.8.16" osisID="Esth.8.16" n="16" />To the Jews there came light and gladness and joy and honor.
<verse eID="Esth.8.16" />
<verse sID="Esth.8.17" osisID="Esth.8.17" n="17" />And in every province and city, wherever the king’s command and decree came, there was gladness and joy among the Jews and a holiday. Many of the peoples of the earth professed to be Jews, for fear of the Jews took possession of them.
<verse eID="Esth.8.17" />
<chapter eID="Esth.8" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Esth.9" osisID="Esth.9" n="9" />
<verse sID="Esth.9.1" osisID="Esth.9.1" n="1" />Now in the twelfth month (that is the month of Adar), on the thirteenth day, when the king’s command and his decree was about to put into execution, on the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to gain the mastery over them, then the tables were turned so that the Jews had the mastery over those who hated them.
<verse eID="Esth.9.1" />
<verse sID="Esth.9.2" osisID="Esth.9.2" n="2" />The Jews gathered together in the cities throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, to attack anyone who tried to harm them. No one could withstand them, for the fear of them had fallen on all the peoples.
<verse eID="Esth.9.2" />
<verse sID="Esth.9.3" osisID="Esth.9.3" n="3" />All the princes of the provinces and the satraps and the governors and they who attended to the king’s business, helped the Jews, because the fear of Mordecai had fallen on them.
<verse eID="Esth.9.3" />
<verse sID="Esth.9.4" osisID="Esth.9.4" n="4" />For Mordecai was great in the king’s palace, and as his power increased his fame spread throughout all the provinces.
<verse eID="Esth.9.4" />
<verse sID="Esth.9.5" osisID="Esth.9.5" n="5" />The Jews put all their enemies to the sword and, with slaughter and destruction, they did what they wanted to those who hated them.
<verse eID="Esth.9.5" />
<verse sID="Esth.9.6" osisID="Esth.9.6" n="6" />In Susa the capital the Jews killed five hundred people.
<verse eID="Esth.9.6" />
<verse sID="Esth.9.7" osisID="Esth.9.7" n="7" />They killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,
<verse eID="Esth.9.7" />
<verse sID="Esth.9.8" osisID="Esth.9.8" n="8" />Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,
<verse eID="Esth.9.8" />
<verse sID="Esth.9.9" osisID="Esth.9.9" n="9" />Parmashta, Arisia, Aridai, and Vaizatha,
<verse eID="Esth.9.9" />
<verse sID="Esth.9.10" osisID="Esth.9.10" n="10" />the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Jews’ enemy; but they did not take any plunder.
<verse eID="Esth.9.10" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Esth.9.11" osisID="Esth.9.11" n="11" />On that day the number of those who were slain in Susa was brought before the king,
<verse eID="Esth.9.11" />
<verse sID="Esth.9.12" osisID="Esth.9.12" n="12" />and the king said to Queen Esther, “The Jews have slain five hundred people in Susa, and the ten sons of Haman. What then have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces! Now what is your petition? It will be granted to you. What is your request? It will be done.”
<verse eID="Esth.9.12" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Esth.9.13" osisID="Esth.9.13" n="13" />“If it please the king,” Esther said, “let it be granted to the Jews who are in Susa to do tomorrow also according to this day’s decree. Let the bodies of Haman’s ten sons be hanged on the gallows.”
<verse eID="Esth.9.13" />
<verse sID="Esth.9.14" osisID="Esth.9.14" n="14" />And the king commanded it to be done. A decree was given out in Susa and they hung the bodies of Haman’s ten sons on the gallows.
<verse eID="Esth.9.14" />
<verse sID="Esth.9.15" osisID="Esth.9.15" n="15" />The Jews who were in Susa gathered themselves together again on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar. They killed three hundred people in Susa. But they did not take any plunder.
<verse eID="Esth.9.15" />
<verse sID="Esth.9.16" osisID="Esth.9.16" n="16" />And the other Jews who were in the king’s provinces gathered themselves together and fought for their lives and overcame their enemies. They killed seventy-five thousand who hated them. But they did not take any plunder.
<verse eID="Esth.9.16" />
<verse sID="Esth.9.17" osisID="Esth.9.17" n="17" />This was on the thirteenth day of Adar.
</p>
<p>
On the fourteenth day of the month Adar the Jews rested and made it a day of feasting and rejoicing.
<verse eID="Esth.9.17" />
<verse sID="Esth.9.18" osisID="Esth.9.18" n="18" />(But the Jews in Susa gathered on both the thirteenth and fourteenth day – and rested on the fifteenth day of the same month and made it a day of feasting and rejoicing.)
<verse eID="Esth.9.18" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Esth.9.19" osisID="Esth.9.19" n="19" />This is why the Jews who live in the country villages keep the fourteenth day of the month of Adar as a day of rejoicing and feasting and a holiday, and a day in which they send gifts of food to each other.
</p>
<verse eID="Esth.9.19" />
<!-- s --><title>The Establishment of Purim</title>
<p>
<verse sID="Esth.9.20" osisID="Esth.9.20" n="20" />Mordecai had these things recorded. He sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of the King Ahasuerus, both near and far.
<verse eID="Esth.9.20" />
<verse sID="Esth.9.21" osisID="Esth.9.21" n="21" />He told them to keep the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and also the fifteenth day every year,
<verse eID="Esth.9.21" />
<verse sID="Esth.9.22" osisID="Esth.9.22" n="22" />as the days on which the Jews had rest from their enemies, and the month which was turned from sorrow to gladness and from mourning into a feast day. They should make them days of feasting and gladness and of sending gifts of food to each other and of gifts to the poor.
<verse eID="Esth.9.22" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Esth.9.23" osisID="Esth.9.23" n="23" />So what the Jews had begun to do they adopted as a custom, just as Mordecai had written to them.
<verse eID="Esth.9.23" />
<verse sID="Esth.9.24" osisID="Esth.9.24" n="24" />For Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted to destroy them. He had cast ‘Pur’, that is the lot, intending to consume them and to destroy them.
<verse eID="Esth.9.24" />
<verse sID="Esth.9.25" osisID="Esth.9.25" n="25" />But when the matter came before the king, he gave written orders that his wicked plot, which he had planned against the Jews, should come upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.
<verse eID="Esth.9.25" />
<verse sID="Esth.9.26" osisID="Esth.9.26" n="26" />This is why these days are called Purim, after the word Pur. Therefore because of all the words of this letter, as well as all they had seen, and all they had experienced,
<verse eID="Esth.9.26" />
<verse sID="Esth.9.27" osisID="Esth.9.27" n="27" />the Jews established and made it a custom for them, for their descendants, and for all who should join them, so that it might not be repealed, that they should continue to observe these two days as feasts each year,
<verse eID="Esth.9.27" />
<verse sID="Esth.9.28" osisID="Esth.9.28" n="28" />and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city. And these days of Purim should not pass away from among the Jews nor the remembrance of them disappear among their descendants.
<verse eID="Esth.9.28" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Esth.9.29" osisID="Esth.9.29" n="29" />Queen Esther, the daughter of Abihail, gave Mordecai the Jew all authority in writing to confirm this second letter of Purim.
<verse eID="Esth.9.29" />
<verse sID="Esth.9.30" osisID="Esth.9.30" n="30" />He sent letters to all the Jews, to the hundred and twenty-seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, wishing them peace and security,
<verse eID="Esth.9.30" />
<verse sID="Esth.9.31" osisID="Esth.9.31" n="31" />to confirm these days of Purim in their proper times, to be observed as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had directed and as the Jews had proscribed for themselves and their descendants, in the matter of the fastings and their cry of lamentation.
<verse eID="Esth.9.31" />
<verse sID="Esth.9.32" osisID="Esth.9.32" n="32" />And the commands of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the records.
<verse eID="Esth.9.32" />
<chapter eID="Esth.9" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Esth.10" osisID="Esth.10" n="10" /> 
<verse sID="Esth.10.1" osisID="Esth.10.1" n="1" />King Ahasuerus imposed a tribute on the land and the coasts.
<verse eID="Esth.10.1" />
<verse sID="Esth.10.2" osisID="Esth.10.2" n="2" />All the acts of his power and of his might, and the full account of the greatness of Mordecai to which the king advanced him, are they not recorded in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?
<verse eID="Esth.10.2" />
<verse sID="Esth.10.3" osisID="Esth.10.3" n="3" />For Mordecai the Jew was next in rank to King Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and loved by them all. He sought the good of his people and promoted the welfare of their descendants.

<verse sID="Hos.1.1" osisID="Hos.1.1" n="1" />The <divineName>Lord</divineName>’s message to Hosea son of Beeri during the reigns of Kings Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah of Judah and during the reign of King Jeroboam, son of Joash of Israel.

<verse eID="Hos.1.1" />
<!-- s --><title>The adultery of Hosea’s wife</title>
<p>
<verse sID="Hos.1.2" osisID="Hos.1.2" n="2" />When the <divineName>Lord</divineName> began to speak through Hosea, he said to him:
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">“Go marry an unfaithful woman</l>
<l level="1">who will bear you children by her adultery,</l>
<l level="1">for like an adulterous wife the land is unfaithful to the <divineName>Lord</divineName>.” <verse eID="Hos.1.2" /></l>
</lg>
<p>
<verse sID="Hos.1.3" osisID="Hos.1.3" n="3" />So he married Gomer, the daughter of Dibliam, and when she conceived and bore him a son,
<verse eID="Hos.1.3" />
<verse sID="Hos.1.4" osisID="Hos.1.4" n="4" />the <divineName>Lord</divineName> said:
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">“Call him ‘Jezreel,’ for in a little while</l>
<l level="1">I will punish the dynasty of Jehu</l>
<l level="1">for the blood shed at the valley of Jezreel,</l>
<l level="1">I will cause the kingdom of Israel to cease. <verse eID="Hos.1.4" /></l>
<l level="1">
<verse sID="Hos.1.5" osisID="Hos.1.5" n="5" />On that day, I will break Israel’s bows and arrows</l>
<l level="1">in the valley of Jezreel.” <verse eID="Hos.1.5" /></l>
</lg>
<p>
<verse sID="Hos.1.6" osisID="Hos.1.6" n="6" />When she conceived again and bore a daughter, the <divineName>Lord</divineName> said to Hosea:
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">“Call her Lo-Ruhamah – ‘No-Compassion’</l>
<l level="1">for I will no longer have compassion on Israel,</l>
<l level="1">certainly not spare them.  <verse eID="Hos.1.6" /></l>
<lb type="x-p" />
<l level="1">
<verse sID="Hos.1.7" osisID="Hos.1.7" n="7" />But on Judah I will have compassion,</l>
<l level="1">I will deliver them by the <divineName>Lord</divineName> their God,</l>
<l level="1">but I will not deliver them by bow nor by sword,</l>
<l level="1">nor by battle nor by horses nor by horsemen.” <verse eID="Hos.1.7" /></l>
</lg>
<p>
<verse sID="Hos.1.8" osisID="Hos.1.8" n="8" />After she had weaned No-Compassion, and when she conceived and bore a son, he said:
<verse eID="Hos.1.8" />
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">
<verse sID="Hos.1.9" osisID="Hos.1.9" n="9" />“Call him Lo-Ammi – ‘Not-My-People’</l>
<l level="1">for you, Israel, are not my people,</l>
<l level="1">and I indeed am not your God.”  <verse eID="Hos.1.9" /></l>
<lb type="x-p" />
<l level="1">
<verse sID="Hos.1.10" osisID="Hos.1.10" n="10" />Yet the number of the Israelites</l>
<l level="1">will be as the sand of the sea,</l>
<l level="1">which cannot be measured or counted,</l>
<l level="1">and where they were told, “You are not my people,”</l>
<l level="1">they will be called, “children of the living God.” <verse eID="Hos.1.10" /></l>
<l level="1">
<verse sID="Hos.1.11" osisID="Hos.1.11" n="11" />The Judeans and the Israelites</l>
<l level="1">will join together again,</l>
<l level="1">will appoint for themselves one leader,</l>
<l level="1">will return to their own land.</l>
<l level="1">Great will be the day of Jezreel!

<l level="1">
<verse sID="Hos.2.2" osisID="Hos.2.2" n="2" />Accuse, accuse your mother:</l>
<l level="1">for she is not my wife,</l>
<l level="1">and I will not be her husband.</l>
<l level="1">Let her put her acts of infidelity out of her sight,</l>
<l level="1">and her lovers from between her breasts, <verse eID="Hos.2.2" /></l>
<l level="1">
<verse sID="Hos.2.3" osisID="Hos.2.3" n="3" />else I will strip her bare,</l>

<l level="1">let her become like a parched land,</l>

<l level="1">
<verse sID="Hos.2.4" osisID="Hos.2.4" n="4" />And on her children I will have no pity,</l>
<l level="1">since they are children of adultery, <verse eID="Hos.2.4" /></l>
<l level="1">
<verse sID="Hos.2.5" osisID="Hos.2.5" n="5" />for their mother has become a prostitute,</l>
<l level="1">she who conceived them has behaved shamefully. </l>
<lb type="x-p" />
<l level="1">She has said,</l>
<l level="1">“I will go after my lovers</l>

<l level="1">
<verse sID="Hos.2.6" osisID="Hos.2.6" n="6" />That is why I am going to hedge up her ways with thorns,</l>
<l level="1">and build a wall about her,</l>
<l level="1">so that she cannot find her paths. <verse eID="Hos.2.6" /></l>
<l level="1">
<verse sID="Hos.2.7" osisID="Hos.2.7" n="7" />She will pursue her lovers,</l>
<l level="1">but will not overtake them.</l>
<l level="1">She will seek them,</l>
<l level="1">but not find them.</l>
<l level="1">In time she will say,</l>
<l level="1">“I will go back to my first husband,</l>
<l level="1">I was better off then than now.” <verse eID="Hos.2.7" /></l>
<l level="1">
<verse sID="Hos.2.8" osisID="Hos.2.8" n="8" />She herself did not know</l>
<l level="1">that it was I who gave her</l>
<l level="1">the grain, the sweet wine, and the oil,</l>
<l level="1">who lavished on her silver and gold –</l>
<l level="1">that they used in worshipping Baal! <verse eID="Hos.2.8" /></l>
<l level="1">
<verse sID="Hos.2.9" osisID="Hos.2.9" n="9" />So I will take back my grain at the harvest,</l>
<l level="1">and my sweet wine in its season.</l>
<l level="1">I will withdraw my wool and my flax,</l>

<l level="1">
<verse sID="Hos.2.10" osisID="Hos.2.10" n="10" />and so I will strip her naked before her lovers,</l>

<l level="1">
<verse sID="Hos.2.11" osisID="Hos.2.11" n="11" />I will end all her celebrations,</l>
<l level="1">her yearly feasts, her new moons, and her sabbaths,</l>
<l level="1">all her festivals. <verse eID="Hos.2.11" /></l>
<l level="1">
<verse sID="Hos.2.12" osisID="Hos.2.12" n="12" />I will lay waste her vines and her fig trees,</l>
<l level="1">of which she says, “These are my wages</l>
<l level="1">which my lovers have given me.”</l>
<l level="1">I will make them a thicket,</l>
<l level="1">and the wild animals will eat them. <verse eID="Hos.2.12" /></l>
<l level="1">
<verse sID="Hos.2.13" osisID="Hos.2.13" n="13" />In this way I will punish her for the days of the Baals,</l>
<l level="1">in which she made offerings to them,</l>
<l level="1">and decked herself with earrings and jewels,</l>
<l level="1">and went after her lovers,</l>

<lb type="x-p" />
<l level="1">
<verse sID="Hos.2.14" osisID="Hos.2.14" n="14" />So I am going to court her,</l>

<l level="1">
<verse sID="Hos.2.15" osisID="Hos.2.15" n="15" />I will give her from there her vineyards,</l>

<l level="1">There she will respond as in the days of her youth,</l>

<l level="1">
<verse sID="Hos.2.16" osisID="Hos.2.16" n="16" />At that time, declares the <divineName>Lord</divineName>,</l>

<l level="1">
<verse sID="Hos.2.17" osisID="Hos.2.17" n="17" />I will remove the name of the Baals from her mouth,</l>

<l level="1">
<verse sID="Hos.2.18" osisID="Hos.2.18" n="18" />On that day I will make for them a covenant</l>
<l level="1">with the wild animals,</l>

<l level="1">I will break the bow and the sword,</l>

<l level="1">

<p>
<verse sID="Hos.3.1" osisID="Hos.3.1" n="1" />Then the <divineName>Lord</divineName> said to me, “Go again, show love to this woman, who is loved by another, who commits adultery. Love her as the <divineName>Lord</divineName> loves the Israelites, though they turn to other gods, and love the raisin cakes offered to idols.
<verse eID="Hos.3.1" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Hos.3.2" osisID="Hos.3.2" n="2" />So I redeemed her for fifteen pieces of silver and a homer and a lethek of barley.
<verse eID="Hos.3.2" />
<verse sID="Hos.3.3" osisID="Hos.3.3" n="3" />And I told her, “You must live with me for many days and you must not sleep around or marry another. And I will do the same for you.
<verse eID="Hos.3.3" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Hos.3.4" osisID="Hos.3.4" n="4" />And like this the Israelites will live for a long time without king and without prince, without sacrifice and without pillar, without ephod and without teraphim.
<verse eID="Hos.3.4" />
<verse sID="Hos.3.5" osisID="Hos.3.5" n="5" />Yet afterward the Israelites will return, and seek the <divineName>Lord</divineName> their God and their Davidic king, and in the days to come they will turn with awe to the <divineName>Lord</divineName> and his goodness.

<verse sID="Jonah.1.1" osisID="Jonah.1.1" n="1" />This message from the <divineName>Lord</divineName> came to Jonah, the son of Amittai:
<verse eID="Jonah.1.1" />
<verse sID="Jonah.1.2" osisID="Jonah.1.2" n="2" />“Arise, go to that great city, Nineveh, and preach against it; for their wickedness is known to me.”
<verse eID="Jonah.1.2" />
<verse sID="Jonah.1.3" osisID="Jonah.1.3" n="3" />But Jonah started to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the <divineName>Lord</divineName>. He went down to Joppa and found a ship going to Tarshish. So he paid the fare and went aboard to go with them to Tarshish from the presence of the <divineName>Lord</divineName>.
<verse eID="Jonah.1.3" />
<verse sID="Jonah.1.4" osisID="Jonah.1.4" n="4" />But the <divineName>Lord</divineName> made a furious wind blow over the sea, and there was such a great storm that the ship was in danger of breaking to pieces.
<verse eID="Jonah.1.4" />
<verse sID="Jonah.1.5" osisID="Jonah.1.5" n="5" />The sailors were terrified and each cried for help to his own god. They threw the ship’s cargo into the sea to make the ship lighter. Meanwhile Jonah had gone down into the bottom of the ship and lay fast asleep.
<verse eID="Jonah.1.5" />
<verse sID="Jonah.1.6" osisID="Jonah.1.6" n="6" />The captain of the ship went and said to him, “How can you sleep? Call on your god; perhaps that god will think of us, so that we may not be lost.”
<verse eID="Jonah.1.6" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Jonah.1.7" osisID="Jonah.1.7" n="7" />The sailors said to one another, “Come, let us cast lots to discover on whose account this evil has come upon us.” So they cast lots, and the lot indicated Jonah.
<verse eID="Jonah.1.7" />
<verse sID="Jonah.1.8" osisID="Jonah.1.8" n="8" />So they said to him, “Are you to blame for this? Tell us, what is your business, and where do you come from? What is your country and to what people do you belong?”
<verse eID="Jonah.1.8" />
<verse sID="Jonah.1.9" osisID="Jonah.1.9" n="9" />He replied, “I am a Hebrew, and a worshipper of the <divineName>Lord</divineName>, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land.”
<verse eID="Jonah.1.9" />
<verse sID="Jonah.1.10" osisID="Jonah.1.10" n="10" />Then the men were greatly frightened and said to him, “What have you done?” For they knew that he was fleeing from the presence of the <divineName>Lord</divineName>, because he had told them.

</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Jonah.1.11" osisID="Jonah.1.11" n="11" />Then they said to him, “What should we do to you, to make the sea calm for us?” For the sea grew more and more stormy.
<verse eID="Jonah.1.11" />
<verse sID="Jonah.1.12" osisID="Jonah.1.12" n="12" />He said to them, “Take me up and throw me into the sea, and the sea will be calm for you, for I know that it is because of me this fierce storm has overtaken you.”

</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Jonah.1.13" osisID="Jonah.1.13" n="13" />But instead the men rowed hard to get back to the land; they could not, however, for the sea grew more and more stormy ahead.
<verse eID="Jonah.1.13" />
<verse sID="Jonah.1.14" osisID="Jonah.1.14" n="14" />So they cried to the <divineName>Lord</divineName> and said, “We beg you, <divineName>Lord</divineName>, we beg you, don’t let us die for this man’s life, and don’t let us be guilty of shedding innocent blood, for you are the <divineName>Lord</divineName>; you have done as it pleases you.”
<verse eID="Jonah.1.14" />
<verse sID="Jonah.1.15" osisID="Jonah.1.15" n="15" />And they took up Jonah, and threw him into the sea; and the sea became calm.
<verse eID="Jonah.1.15" />
<verse sID="Jonah.1.16" osisID="Jonah.1.16" n="16" />Then the men greatly feared the <divineName>Lord</divineName>, and they offered a sacrifice and made vows to him.

<verse eID="Matt.1.16" />
<verse sID="Matt.1.17" osisID="Matt.1.17" n="17" />So the whole number of generations from Abraham to David is fourteen; from David to the Exile to Babylon fourteen; and from the Exile to Babylon to the Christ fourteen.
<verse eID="Matt.1.17" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.1.18" osisID="Matt.1.18" n="18" />This is how Jesus Christ was born:
</p>
<p>
His mother Mary was engaged to Joseph, but, before the marriage took place, she found herself to be pregnant by the power of the Holy Spirit.
<verse eID="Matt.1.18" />
<verse sID="Matt.1.19" osisID="Matt.1.19" n="19" />Her husband, Joseph, was a just man and, since he did not want to disgrace her publicly, he resolved to put an end to their engagement privately.
<verse eID="Matt.1.19" />
<verse sID="Matt.1.20" osisID="Matt.1.20" n="20" />He had been thinking this over, when an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream.
</p>
<p>
“Joseph, son of David,” the angel said, “do not be afraid to take Mary for your wife, for her child has been conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit.
<verse eID="Matt.1.20" />
<verse sID="Matt.1.21" osisID="Matt.1.21" n="21" />She will give birth to a son; name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.”
<verse eID="Matt.1.21" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.1.22" osisID="Matt.1.22" n="22" />All this happened in fulfillment of these words of the Lord through the prophet, where he says –

– a word which means ‘God is with us.’
<verse eID="Matt.1.23" />
<verse sID="Matt.1.24" osisID="Matt.1.24" n="24" />When Joseph woke up, he did as the angel of the Lord had directed him.
<verse eID="Matt.1.24" />
<verse sID="Matt.1.25" osisID="Matt.1.25" n="25" />He made Mary his wife, but they did not sleep together before the birth of her son; and to this son he gave the name Jesus.
<verse eID="Matt.1.25" />

</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Matt.2" osisID="Matt.2" n="2" />
<verse sID="Matt.2.1" osisID="Matt.2.1" n="1" />After the birth of Jesus at Bethlehem in Judea, in the reign of King Herod, some astrologers from the East arrived in Jerusalem, asking,
<verse eID="Matt.2.1" />
<verse sID="Matt.2.2" osisID="Matt.2.2" n="2" />“Where is the newborn king of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east, and have come to worship him.”
<verse eID="Matt.2.2" />
<verse sID="Matt.2.3" osisID="Matt.2.3" n="3" />When King Herod heard of this, he was much troubled, and so too was all Jerusalem.
<verse eID="Matt.2.3" />
<verse sID="Matt.2.4" osisID="Matt.2.4" n="4" />He called together all the chief priests and teachers of the Law in the nation, and questioned them as to where the Christ was to be born.
<verse eID="Matt.2.4" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.2.5" osisID="Matt.2.5" n="5" />“At Bethlehem in Judea,” was their answer, “for it is said in the prophet –
<verse eID="Matt.2.5" />
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">
<verse sID="Matt.2.6" osisID="Matt.2.6" n="6" />‘And you, Bethlehem in Judah’s land,</l>
<l level="2">are in no way least among the chief cities of Judah,</l>
<l level="1">for out of you will come a ruler –</l>
<l level="2">who will shepherd my people Israel.’” <verse eID="Matt.2.6" /></l>
</lg>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.2.7" osisID="Matt.2.7" n="7" />Then Herod secretly sent for the astrologers. He found out from them the time of the appearance of the star.
<verse eID="Matt.2.7" />
<verse sID="Matt.2.8" osisID="Matt.2.8" n="8" />Sending them to Bethlehem he said, “Go and make a careful search for the child. When you have found him, bring word back to me, so that I, too, can go and worship him.”
<verse eID="Matt.2.8" />
<verse sID="Matt.2.9" osisID="Matt.2.9" n="9" />The astrologers heard what the king had to say, and then continued their journey. The star which they had seen in the east led them on, until it reached and stood over the place where the child was.
<verse eID="Matt.2.9" />
<verse sID="Matt.2.10" osisID="Matt.2.10" n="10" />At the sight of the star they were filled with joy.
<verse eID="Matt.2.10" />
<verse sID="Matt.2.11" osisID="Matt.2.11" n="11" />Entering the house, they saw the child with his mother, Mary, and fell at his feet and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasure chests, and offered to the child presents of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
<verse eID="Matt.2.11" />
<verse sID="Matt.2.12" osisID="Matt.2.12" n="12" />But afterward, having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their own country by another road.
<verse eID="Matt.2.12" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.2.13" osisID="Matt.2.13" n="13" />After they had left, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, and said, “Get up, take the child and his mother, and seek refuge in Egypt; and stay there until I tell you to return, for Herod is about to search for the child, to put him to death.”
<verse eID="Matt.2.13" />
<verse sID="Matt.2.14" osisID="Matt.2.14" n="14" />Joseph woke up, and taking the child and his mother by night, went into Egypt,
<verse eID="Matt.2.14" />
<verse sID="Matt.2.15" osisID="Matt.2.15" n="15" />and there he stayed until Herod’s death; in fulfillment of these words of the Lord in the prophet, where he says –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘Out of Egypt I called my Son.’ <verse eID="Matt.2.15" /></l>
</lg>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.2.16" osisID="Matt.2.16" n="16" />When Herod found out that the astrologers had tricked him, he flew into a rage. He sent and put to death all the boys in Bethlehem and the whole of that region, who were two years old or under, guided by the time which he had learned from the astrologers.
<verse eID="Matt.2.16" />
<verse sID="Matt.2.17" osisID="Matt.2.17" n="17" />Then were fulfilled these words spoken in the prophet Jeremiah, where he says –
<verse eID="Matt.2.17" />
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">
<verse sID="Matt.2.18" osisID="Matt.2.18" n="18" />‘A voice was heard in Ramah,</l>
<l level="2">weeping and mourning loudly;</l>
<l level="1">Rachel, weeping for her children,</l>
<l level="2">refusing all comfort for they were dead.’ <verse eID="Matt.2.18" /></l>
</lg>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.2.19" osisID="Matt.2.19" n="19" />But, on the death of Herod, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, and said,
<verse eID="Matt.2.19" />
<verse sID="Matt.2.20" osisID="Matt.2.20" n="20" />“Get up, take the child and his mother, and go into the Land of Israel, for those who sought to take the child’s life are dead.”
<verse eID="Matt.2.20" />
<verse sID="Matt.2.21" osisID="Matt.2.21" n="21" />He woke up, and taking the child and his mother, went into the Land of Israel.
<verse eID="Matt.2.21" />
<verse sID="Matt.2.22" osisID="Matt.2.22" n="22" />But, hearing that Archelaus had succeeded his father Herod as king of Judea, he was afraid to go back there; and having been warned in a dream, he went into the part of the country called Galilee.
<verse eID="Matt.2.22" />
<verse sID="Matt.2.23" osisID="Matt.2.23" n="23" />There he settled in the town of Nazareth, in fulfillment of these words in the prophets – ‘He will be called a Nazarene.’

</p>
<!-- s --><title>The Preparation</title>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.3.1" osisID="Matt.3.1" n="1" />About that time John the Baptist first appeared, proclaiming in the wilderness of Judea:
<verse eID="Matt.3.1" />
<verse sID="Matt.3.2" osisID="Matt.3.2" n="2" />“Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.”
<verse eID="Matt.3.2" />
<verse sID="Matt.3.3" osisID="Matt.3.3" n="3" />John was the one who was spoken of in the prophet Isaiah, where he says –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness:</l>
<l level="1">“Make ready the way of the Lord,</l>
<l level="1">make his paths straight.”’ <verse eID="Matt.3.3" /></l>
</lg>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.3.4" osisID="Matt.3.4" n="4" />John’s clothes were made of camels’ hair, with a leather strap around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey.
<verse eID="Matt.3.4" />
<verse sID="Matt.3.5" osisID="Matt.3.5" n="5" />At that time Jerusalem, and all Judea, as well as the whole district of the Jordan, went out to him
<verse eID="Matt.3.5" />
<verse sID="Matt.3.6" osisID="Matt.3.6" n="6" />and were baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.
<verse eID="Matt.3.6" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.3.7" osisID="Matt.3.7" n="7" />But when John saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to receive his baptism, he said to them, “You children of snakes! Who has prompted you to seek refuge from the coming judgment?
<verse eID="Matt.3.7" />
<verse sID="Matt.3.8" osisID="Matt.3.8" n="8" />Let your life, then, prove your repentance;
<verse eID="Matt.3.8" />
<verse sID="Matt.3.9" osisID="Matt.3.9" n="9" />and do not think that you can say among yourselves ‘Abraham is our ancestor,’ for I tell you that out of these stones God is able to raise descendants for Abraham!
<verse eID="Matt.3.9" />
<verse sID="Matt.3.10" osisID="Matt.3.10" n="10" />Already the axe is lying at the root of the trees. Therefore every tree that fails to bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.
<verse eID="Matt.3.10" />
<verse sID="Matt.3.11" osisID="Matt.3.11" n="11" />I, indeed, baptize you with water to teach repentance; but he who is coming after me is more powerful than I, and I am not fit even to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.
<verse eID="Matt.3.11" />
<verse sID="Matt.3.12" osisID="Matt.3.12" n="12" />His winnowing-fan is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing-floor, and store his grain in the barn, but the chaff he will burn with a fire that cannot be put out.”
<verse eID="Matt.3.12" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.3.13" osisID="Matt.3.13" n="13" />Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan, to John, to be baptized by him.
<verse eID="Matt.3.13" />
<verse sID="Matt.3.14" osisID="Matt.3.14" n="14" />But John tried to prevent him.
</p>
<p>
“I need to be baptized by you,” he said, “so why have you come to me?”
<verse eID="Matt.3.14" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.3.15" osisID="Matt.3.15" n="15" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“This is the way it should be for now,”</q>  Jesus answered, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“because we should do everything that God requires.”</q>  So John agreed.
<verse eID="Matt.3.15" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.3.16" osisID="Matt.3.16" n="16" />After the baptism of Jesus, and just as he came up from the water, the heavens opened, and he saw the Spirit of God coming down like a dove and resting on him,
<verse eID="Matt.3.16" />
<verse sID="Matt.3.17" osisID="Matt.3.17" n="17" />and from the heavens there came a voice which said, “This is my dearly loved son, who brings me great joy.”
<verse eID="Matt.3.17" />

</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Matt.4" osisID="Matt.4" n="4" />
<verse sID="Matt.4.1" osisID="Matt.4.1" n="1" />Then Jesus was led up into the wilderness by the Spirit to be tempted by the devil.
<verse eID="Matt.4.1" />
<verse sID="Matt.4.2" osisID="Matt.4.2" n="2" />And, after he had fasted for forty days and forty nights, he became hungry.
<verse eID="Matt.4.2" />
<verse sID="Matt.4.3" osisID="Matt.4.3" n="3" />The Tempter came to him, and said:

<p>
<chapter sID="Matt.8" osisID="Matt.8" n="8" />
<verse sID="Matt.8.1" osisID="Matt.8.1" n="1" />When Jesus had come down from the hill, great crowds followed him.
<verse eID="Matt.8.1" />
<verse sID="Matt.8.2" osisID="Matt.8.2" n="2" />He saw a leper who came up, and bowed to the ground before him, and said, “Master, if only you are willing, you are able to make me clean.”

<verse eID="Matt.8.4" />

<verse eID="Matt.8.8" />
<verse sID="Matt.8.9" osisID="Matt.8.9" n="9" />For I myself am a man under the orders of others, with soldiers under me; and, if I say to one of them ‘Go,’ he goes, and to another ‘Come,’ he comes, and to my slave ‘Do this,’ he does it.”
<verse eID="Matt.8.9" />
<verse sID="Matt.8.10" osisID="Matt.8.10" n="10" />Jesus was surprised to hear this, and said to those who were following him, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Never I tell you, in any Israelite have I met with such faith as this!</q>

</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.8.14" osisID="Matt.8.14" n="14" />When Jesus went into Peter’s house, he saw Peter’s mother-in-law prostrated with fever.

<verse sID="Matt.8.16" osisID="Matt.8.16" n="16" />In the evening the people brought to Jesus many who were possessed by demons; and he drove out the spirits with a word, and cured all who were ill,

</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.8.18" osisID="Matt.8.18" n="18" />Seeing a crowd around him, Jesus gave orders to go across.
<verse eID="Matt.8.18" />
<verse sID="Matt.8.19" osisID="Matt.8.19" n="19" />A teacher of the Law came up to him, and said, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.”

<verse eID="Matt.8.23" />
<verse sID="Matt.8.24" osisID="Matt.8.24" n="24" />Suddenly so great a storm came up on the sea, that the waves broke right over the boat. But Jesus was asleep;
<verse eID="Matt.8.24" />
<verse sID="Matt.8.25" osisID="Matt.8.25" n="25" />and the disciples came and roused him. “Master,” they cried, “save us; we are lost!”

</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.8.26" osisID="Matt.8.26" n="26" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Why are you so timid?”</q>  he said. <q who="Jesus" marker="">“You of little faith!”</q>  Then Jesus rose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and a great calm followed.
<verse eID="Matt.8.26" />
<verse sID="Matt.8.27" osisID="Matt.8.27" n="27" />The men were amazed, and exclaimed, “What kind of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!”
<verse eID="Matt.8.27" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.8.28" osisID="Matt.8.28" n="28" />On getting to the other side – the region of the Gadarenes – Jesus met two men who were possessed by demons, coming out of the tombs. They were so violent that no one was able to pass that way.
<verse eID="Matt.8.28" />
<verse sID="Matt.8.29" osisID="Matt.8.29" n="29" />Suddenly they shrieked out, “What do you want with us, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before our time?”
<verse eID="Matt.8.29" />
<verse sID="Matt.8.30" osisID="Matt.8.30" n="30" />A long way off, there was a drove of many pigs, feeding;
<verse eID="Matt.8.30" />
<verse sID="Matt.8.31" osisID="Matt.8.31" n="31" />and the foul spirits began begging Jesus, “If you drive us out, send us into the drove of pigs.”

</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.8.32" osisID="Matt.8.32" n="32" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Go,”</q>  he said. The spirits came out, and entered the pigs; and the whole drove rushed down the steep slope into the sea, and died in the water.
<verse eID="Matt.8.32" />
<verse sID="Matt.8.33" osisID="Matt.8.33" n="33" />At this the men who tended them ran away and went to the town, carrying the news of all that had occurred, and of what had happened to the possessed men.
<verse eID="Matt.8.33" />
<verse sID="Matt.8.34" osisID="Matt.8.34" n="34" />At the news the whole town went out to meet Jesus, and, when they saw him, they entreated him to go away from their region.

<p>
<chapter sID="Matt.9" osisID="Matt.9" n="9" />
<verse sID="Matt.9.1" osisID="Matt.9.1" n="1" />Afterward Jesus got into a boat, and, crossing over, came to his own city.
<verse eID="Matt.9.1" />
<verse sID="Matt.9.2" osisID="Matt.9.2" n="2" />There some people brought to him a paralyzed man on a bed. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the man, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Courage, child! Your sins are forgiven.”</q>
<verse eID="Matt.9.2" />
<verse sID="Matt.9.3" osisID="Matt.9.3" n="3" />Then some of the teachers of the Law said to themselves, “This man is blaspheming!”
<verse eID="Matt.9.3" />
<verse sID="Matt.9.4" osisID="Matt.9.4" n="4" />Knowing their thoughts, Jesus exclaimed, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Why do your cherish such wicked thoughts?</q>

<verse eID="Matt.9.6" />
<verse sID="Matt.9.7" osisID="Matt.9.7" n="7" />The man got up and went to his home.
<verse eID="Matt.9.7" />
<verse sID="Matt.9.8" osisID="Matt.9.8" n="8" />When the crowd saw this, they were awe-struck, and praised God for giving such power to human beings.
<verse eID="Matt.9.8" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.9.9" osisID="Matt.9.9" n="9" />As Jesus went along, he saw a man, called Matthew, sitting in the tax office, and said to him, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Follow me.”</q>  Matthew got up and followed him.

</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.9.10" osisID="Matt.9.10" n="10" />And, later on, when he was having dinner in the house, a number of tax-gatherers and outcasts came in and took their places at the table with Jesus and his disciples.
<verse eID="Matt.9.10" />
<verse sID="Matt.9.11" osisID="Matt.9.11" n="11" />When the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat in the company of tax-gatherers and outcasts?”

<verse sID="Matt.9.13" osisID="Matt.9.13" n="13" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">Go and learn what this means – ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice’; for I did not come to call the religious, but the outcast.”</q>
<verse eID="Matt.9.13" />
<verse sID="Matt.9.14" osisID="Matt.9.14" n="14" />Then John’s disciples came to Jesus, and asked, “Why do we and the Pharisees fast while your disciples do not?”
<verse eID="Matt.9.14" />
<verse sID="Matt.9.15" osisID="Matt.9.15" n="15" />Jesus answered, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Can the groom’s friends mourn as long as the groom is with them? But the days will come, when the groom will be taken away from them, and they will fast then.</q>

</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.9.18" osisID="Matt.9.18" n="18" />While Jesus was saying this, a synagogue leader came up and bowed to the ground before him. “My daughter,” he said, “has just died; but come and place your hand on her, and she will be restored to life.”
<verse eID="Matt.9.18" />
<verse sID="Matt.9.19" osisID="Matt.9.19" n="19" />So Jesus rose and followed him, and his disciples went also.
<verse eID="Matt.9.19" />
<verse sID="Matt.9.20" osisID="Matt.9.20" n="20" />But meanwhile a woman, who had been suffering from hemorrhage for twelve years, came up behind and touched the tassel of his cloak.
<verse eID="Matt.9.20" />
<verse sID="Matt.9.21" osisID="Matt.9.21" n="21" />“If I only touch his cloak,” she said to herself, “I will get well.”
<verse eID="Matt.9.21" />
<verse sID="Matt.9.22" osisID="Matt.9.22" n="22" />Turning and seeing her, Jesus said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Courage, daughter! Your faith has delivered you.”</q>  And at that very moment she became well.

<verse sID="Matt.9.24" osisID="Matt.9.24" n="24" />he said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Go away, the little girl is not dead; she is asleep.”</q>  They began to laugh at him;
<verse eID="Matt.9.24" />
<verse sID="Matt.9.25" osisID="Matt.9.25" n="25" />but, when the people had been sent out, Jesus went in, and took the little girl’s hand, and she rose.
<verse eID="Matt.9.25" />
<verse sID="Matt.9.26" osisID="Matt.9.26" n="26" />The report of this spread through all that part of the country.
<verse eID="Matt.9.26" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.9.27" osisID="Matt.9.27" n="27" />As Jesus was passing on from there, he was followed by two blind men, who kept calling out, “Take pity on us, Son of David!”
<verse eID="Matt.9.27" />
<verse sID="Matt.9.28" osisID="Matt.9.28" n="28" />When he had gone indoors, the blind men came up to him; and Jesus asked them, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Do you believe that I am able to do this?”</q>  “Yes, Master!” they answered.

<verse eID="Matt.9.29" />
<verse sID="Matt.9.30" osisID="Matt.9.30" n="30" />Then their eyes were opened. Jesus sternly cautioned them. <q who="Jesus" marker="">“See that no one knows of it,”</q>  he said.
<verse eID="Matt.9.30" />
<verse sID="Matt.9.31" osisID="Matt.9.31" n="31" />But the men went out, and spread the news about him through all that part of the country.
<verse eID="Matt.9.31" />
<verse sID="Matt.9.32" osisID="Matt.9.32" n="32" />Just as they were going out, some people brought up to Jesus a dumb man who was possessed by a demon;
<verse eID="Matt.9.32" />
<verse sID="Matt.9.33" osisID="Matt.9.33" n="33" />and, as soon as the demon had been driven out, the dumb man spoke. The people were astonished at this, and exclaimed, “Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel!”
<verse eID="Matt.9.33" />
<verse sID="Matt.9.34" osisID="Matt.9.34" n="34" />But the Pharisees said, “He drives out the demons by the help of the chief of the demons.”

<verse sID="Matt.9.36" osisID="Matt.9.36" n="36" />But, when he saw the crowds, his heart was moved with compassion for them, because they were distressed and harassed, like sheep without a shepherd;

<verse sID="Matt.13.54" osisID="Matt.13.54" n="54" />Going to his own part of the country, he taught the people in their synagogue in such a manner that they were deeply impressed. “Where did he get this wisdom?” they said, “and the miracles?

<p>
<chapter sID="Matt.14" osisID="Matt.14" n="14" />
<verse sID="Matt.14.1" osisID="Matt.14.1" n="1" />At that time Prince Herod heard of the fame of Jesus,
<verse eID="Matt.14.1" />
<verse sID="Matt.14.2" osisID="Matt.14.2" n="2" />and said to his attendants, “This must be John the Baptist; he must be risen from the dead, and that is why these miraculous powers are active in him.”
<verse eID="Matt.14.2" />
<verse sID="Matt.14.3" osisID="Matt.14.3" n="3" />For Herod had arrested John, put him in chains, and shut him up in prison, to please Herodias, the wife of Herod’s brother Philip.
<verse eID="Matt.14.3" />
<verse sID="Matt.14.4" osisID="Matt.14.4" n="4" />For John had said to him ‘You have no right to be living with her.’
<verse eID="Matt.14.4" />
<verse sID="Matt.14.5" osisID="Matt.14.5" n="5" />Yet, though Herod wanted to put him to death, he was afraid of the people, because they looked on John as a prophet.
<verse eID="Matt.14.5" />
<verse sID="Matt.14.6" osisID="Matt.14.6" n="6" />But, when Herod’s birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before his guests, and so pleased Herod,

<verse sID="Matt.14.7" osisID="Matt.14.7" n="7" />that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked.
<verse eID="Matt.14.7" />
<verse sID="Matt.14.8" osisID="Matt.14.8" n="8" />Prompted by her mother, the girl said ‘Give me here, on a dish, the head of John the Baptist.’
<verse eID="Matt.14.8" />
<verse sID="Matt.14.9" osisID="Matt.14.9" n="9" />The king was distressed at this; yet, because of his oath and of the guests at his table, he ordered it to be given her.
<verse eID="Matt.14.9" />
<verse sID="Matt.14.10" osisID="Matt.14.10" n="10" />He had John beheaded in the prison
<verse eID="Matt.14.10" />
<verse sID="Matt.14.11" osisID="Matt.14.11" n="11" />and his head was brought on a dish and given to the girl, and she took it to her mother.
<verse eID="Matt.14.11" />
<verse sID="Matt.14.12" osisID="Matt.14.12" n="12" />Then John’s disciples came, and took the body away, and buried it; and went and told Jesus.
<verse eID="Matt.14.12" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.14.13" osisID="Matt.14.13" n="13" />When Jesus heard of it, he left privately in a boat to a lonely spot. The people, however, heard of his going, and followed him in crowds from the towns on foot.
<verse eID="Matt.14.13" />
<verse sID="Matt.14.14" osisID="Matt.14.14" n="14" />On getting out of the boat, Jesus saw a great crowd, and his heart was moved at the sight of them; and he cured all the sick among them.
<verse eID="Matt.14.14" />
<verse sID="Matt.14.15" osisID="Matt.14.15" n="15" />In the evening the disciples came up to him, and said, “This is a lonely spot, and the day is now far advanced; send the crowds away so that they can to the villages, and buy themselves food.”
<verse eID="Matt.14.15" />
<verse sID="Matt.14.16" osisID="Matt.14.16" n="16" />But Jesus said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“They need not go away, it is for you to give them something to eat.”</q>

<verse eID="Matt.14.18" />
<verse sID="Matt.14.19" osisID="Matt.14.19" n="19" />Jesus ordered the people to take their seats on the grass; and, taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven, and said the blessing, and, after he had broken the loaves, gave them to his disciples; and they gave them to the crowds.
<verse eID="Matt.14.19" />
<verse sID="Matt.14.20" osisID="Matt.14.20" n="20" />Everyone had sufficient to eat, and they picked up enough of the broken pieces that were left to fill twelve baskets.
<verse eID="Matt.14.20" />
<verse sID="Matt.14.21" osisID="Matt.14.21" n="21" />The men who ate were about five thousand in number, without counting women and children.
<verse eID="Matt.14.21" />
<verse sID="Matt.14.22" osisID="Matt.14.22" n="22" />Immediately afterward Jesus made the disciples get into a boat and cross over in advance of him, while he dismissed the crowds.
<verse eID="Matt.14.22" />
<verse sID="Matt.14.23" osisID="Matt.14.23" n="23" />After dismissing the crowds, he went up the hill by himself to pray; and, when evening fell, he was there alone.
<verse eID="Matt.14.23" />
<verse sID="Matt.14.24" osisID="Matt.14.24" n="24" />The boat was by this time some miles from shore, laboring in the waves, for the wind was against her.

<verse sID="Matt.14.25" osisID="Matt.14.25" n="25" />Three hours after midnight, however, Jesus came towards the disciples, walking on the water.
<verse eID="Matt.14.25" />
<verse sID="Matt.14.26" osisID="Matt.14.26" n="26" />But, when they saw him walking on the water, they were terrified. “It is a ghost,” they exclaimed, and cried out in fear.
<verse eID="Matt.14.26" />
<verse sID="Matt.14.27" osisID="Matt.14.27" n="27" />But Jesus at once spoke to them. <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Courage!”</q>  he said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“It is I; do not be afraid!”</q>
<verse eID="Matt.14.27" />
<verse sID="Matt.14.28" osisID="Matt.14.28" n="28" />“Master,” Peter exclaimed, “if it is you, tell me to come to you on the water.”
<verse eID="Matt.14.28" />
<verse sID="Matt.14.29" osisID="Matt.14.29" n="29" />Jesus said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Come.”</q>  So Peter got down from the boat, and walked on the water, and went towards Jesus;
<verse eID="Matt.14.29" />
<verse sID="Matt.14.30" osisID="Matt.14.30" n="30" />but, when he felt the wind, he was frightened, and, beginning to sink, cried out, “Master! Save me!”
<verse eID="Matt.14.30" />
<verse sID="Matt.14.31" osisID="Matt.14.31" n="31" />Instantly Jesus stretched out his hand, and caught hold of him. <q who="Jesus" marker="">“You of little faith!”</q>  he said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Why did you falter?”</q>
<verse eID="Matt.14.31" />
<verse sID="Matt.14.32" osisID="Matt.14.32" n="32" />When they had got into the boat, the wind dropped.
<verse eID="Matt.14.32" />
<verse sID="Matt.14.33" osisID="Matt.14.33" n="33" />But the men in the boat threw themselves on their faces before him, and said, “You are indeed God’s Son.”
<verse eID="Matt.14.33" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.14.34" osisID="Matt.14.34" n="34" />When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret.
<verse eID="Matt.14.34" />
<verse sID="Matt.14.35" osisID="Matt.14.35" n="35" />But the people of that place, recognizing Jesus, sent out to the whole country around, and brought to him all who were ill,
<verse eID="Matt.14.35" />
<verse sID="Matt.14.36" osisID="Matt.14.36" n="36" />begging him merely to let them touch the tassel of his cloak; and all who touched were made perfectly well.

<p>
<chapter sID="Matt.15" osisID="Matt.15" n="15" />
<verse sID="Matt.15.1" osisID="Matt.15.1" n="1" />Then some Pharisees and teachers of the Law came to Jesus, and said,
<verse eID="Matt.15.1" />
<verse sID="Matt.15.2" osisID="Matt.15.2" n="2" />“How is it that your disciples break the traditions of our ancestors? For they do not wash their hands when they eat food.”
<verse eID="Matt.15.2" />
<verse sID="Matt.15.3" osisID="Matt.15.3" n="3" />His reply was, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“How is it that you on your side break God’s commandments out of respect for your own traditions?</q>
<verse eID="Matt.15.3" />
<verse sID="Matt.15.4" osisID="Matt.15.4" n="4" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">For God said – ‘Honor your father and mother,’ and ‘Anyone who abuses his father or mother shall suffer death,’</q>
<verse eID="Matt.15.4" />
<verse sID="Matt.15.5" osisID="Matt.15.5" n="5" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">but you say ‘Whenever anyone says to his father or mother “Whatever of mine might have been of service to you is set apart for God,”</q>

<verse sID="Matt.15.6" osisID="Matt.15.6" n="6" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">he is in no way bound to honor his father.’ In this way you have nullified the words of God for the sake of your traditions.</q>
<verse eID="Matt.15.6" />
<verse sID="Matt.15.7" osisID="Matt.15.7" n="7" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">Hypocrites! It was well said by Isaiah when he prophesied about you –</q>

<verse eID="Matt.15.9" />
<verse sID="Matt.15.10" osisID="Matt.15.10" n="10" />Then Jesus called the people to him, and said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Listen, and mark my words.</q>

<verse sID="Matt.15.11" osisID="Matt.15.11" n="11" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">It is not what enters a person’s mouth that defiles them, but what comes out from their mouth – that does defile them!”</q>
<verse eID="Matt.15.11" />
<verse sID="Matt.15.12" osisID="Matt.15.12" n="12" />His disciples came up to him, and said, “Do you know that the Pharisees were shocked on hearing what you said?”
<verse eID="Matt.15.12" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.15.13" osisID="Matt.15.13" n="13" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Every plant,”</q>  Jesus replied, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“that my heavenly Father has not planted will be rooted up.</q>

<verse eID="Matt.15.14" />
<verse sID="Matt.15.15" osisID="Matt.15.15" n="15" />Peter spoke up, “Explain this saying to us.”

</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.15.16" osisID="Matt.15.16" n="16" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“What, do even you understand nothing yet?”</q>  Jesus exclaimed.

<verse eID="Matt.15.20" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.15.21" osisID="Matt.15.21" n="21" />On going away from that place, Jesus went to the country around Tyre and Sidon.
<verse eID="Matt.15.21" />
<verse sID="Matt.15.22" osisID="Matt.15.22" n="22" />There, a Canaanite woman of that district came out and began calling to Jesus, “Take pity on me, Master, Son of David; my daughter is grievously possessed by a demon.”
<verse eID="Matt.15.22" />
<verse sID="Matt.15.23" osisID="Matt.15.23" n="23" />But Jesus did not answer her a word; and his disciples came up and begged him to send her away. “She keeps calling out after us,” they said.
<verse eID="Matt.15.23" />
<verse sID="Matt.15.24" osisID="Matt.15.24" n="24" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“I was not sent,”</q>  replied Jesus, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“to anyone except the lost sheep of Israel.”</q>
<verse eID="Matt.15.24" />
<verse sID="Matt.15.25" osisID="Matt.15.25" n="25" />But the woman came, and, bowing to the ground before him, said, “Master, help me.”
<verse eID="Matt.15.25" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.15.26" osisID="Matt.15.26" n="26" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“It is not fair,”</q>  replied Jesus, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“to take the children’s food and throw it to dogs.”</q>
<verse eID="Matt.15.26" />
<verse sID="Matt.15.27" osisID="Matt.15.27" n="27" />“Yes, Master,” she said, “for even dogs do feed on the scraps that fall from their owners’ table.”
<verse eID="Matt.15.27" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.15.28" osisID="Matt.15.28" n="28" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Your faith is great,”</q>  was his reply to the woman, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“it will be as you wish!”</q>  And her daughter was cured that very hour.
<verse eID="Matt.15.28" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.15.29" osisID="Matt.15.29" n="29" />On leaving that place, Jesus went to the shore of the Sea of Galilee; and then went up the hill, and sat down.
<verse eID="Matt.15.29" />
<verse sID="Matt.15.30" osisID="Matt.15.30" n="30" />Great crowds of people came to him, bringing with them those who were lame, crippled, blind, or dumb, and many others. They put them down at his feet, and he cured them;
<verse eID="Matt.15.30" />
<verse sID="Matt.15.31" osisID="Matt.15.31" n="31" />and the crowds were astonished, when they saw the dumb talking, the cripples made sound, the lame walking about, and the blind with their sight restored; and they praised the God of Israel.
<verse eID="Matt.15.31" />
<verse sID="Matt.15.32" osisID="Matt.15.32" n="32" />Afterward Jesus called his disciples to him, and said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“My heart is moved at the sight of all these people, for they have already been with me three days and they have nothing to eat; and I am unwilling to send them away hungry; they might faint on the way home.”</q>
<verse eID="Matt.15.32" />
<verse sID="Matt.15.33" osisID="Matt.15.33" n="33" />“Where can we,” his disciples asked, “in a lonely place find enough bread for such a crowd as this?”
<verse eID="Matt.15.33" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.15.34" osisID="Matt.15.34" n="34" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“How many loaves have you?”</q>  said Jesus. “Seven,” they answered, “and a few small fish.”
<verse eID="Matt.15.34" />
<verse sID="Matt.15.35" osisID="Matt.15.35" n="35" />Telling the crowd to sit down on the ground,
<verse eID="Matt.15.35" />
<verse sID="Matt.15.36" osisID="Matt.15.36" n="36" />Jesus took the seven loaves and the fish, and, after saying the thanksgiving, broke them, and gave them to the disciples; and the disciples gave them to the crowds.
<verse eID="Matt.15.36" />
<verse sID="Matt.15.37" osisID="Matt.15.37" n="37" />Everyone had sufficient to eat, and they picked up seven baskets full of the broken pieces left.
<verse eID="Matt.15.37" />
<verse sID="Matt.15.38" osisID="Matt.15.38" n="38" />The men who ate were four thousand in number without counting women and children.
<verse eID="Matt.15.38" />
<verse sID="Matt.15.39" osisID="Matt.15.39" n="39" />Then, after dismissing the crowds, Jesus got into the boat, and went to the region of Magadan.
<verse eID="Matt.15.39" />
<chapter eID="Matt.15" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Matt.16" osisID="Matt.16" n="16" />
<verse sID="Matt.16.1" osisID="Matt.16.1" n="1" />Here the Pharisees and Sadducees came up, and, to test Jesus, requested him to show them some sign from the heavens.
<verse eID="Matt.16.1" />
<verse sID="Matt.16.2" osisID="Matt.16.2" n="2" />But Jesus answered, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“In the evening you say ‘It will be fine weather, for the sky is as red as fire.’</q>
<verse eID="Matt.16.2" />
<verse sID="Matt.16.3" osisID="Matt.16.3" n="3" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">But in the morning you say ‘Today it will be stormy, for the sky is as red as fire and threatening.’ You learn to read the sky; yet you are unable to read the signs of the times!</q>
<verse eID="Matt.16.3" />
<verse sID="Matt.16.4" osisID="Matt.16.4" n="4" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">A wicked and unfaithful generation is asking for a sign, but no sign will be given it except the sign of Jonah.”</q>  So he left them and went away.
<verse eID="Matt.16.4" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.16.5" osisID="Matt.16.5" n="5" />Now the disciples had crossed to the opposite shore, and had forgotten to take any bread.
<verse eID="Matt.16.5" />
<verse sID="Matt.16.6" osisID="Matt.16.6" n="6" />Presently Jesus said to them, “Take care and be on your guard against the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”
<verse eID="Matt.16.6" />
<verse sID="Matt.16.7" osisID="Matt.16.7" n="7" />But the disciples began talking among themselves about their having brought no bread.
<verse eID="Matt.16.7" />
<verse sID="Matt.16.8" osisID="Matt.16.8" n="8" />On noticing this, Jesus said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Why are you talking among yourselves about your being short of bread, you of little faith?</q>
<verse eID="Matt.16.8" />
<verse sID="Matt.16.9" osisID="Matt.16.9" n="9" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">Don’t you yet see, nor remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you took away?</q>
<verse eID="Matt.16.9" />
<verse sID="Matt.16.10" osisID="Matt.16.10" n="10" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">Nor yet the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many basketfuls you took away?</q>
<verse eID="Matt.16.10" />
<verse sID="Matt.16.11" osisID="Matt.16.11" n="11" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">How is it that you do not see that I was not speaking about bread? Be on your guard against the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”</q>
<verse eID="Matt.16.11" />
<verse sID="Matt.16.12" osisID="Matt.16.12" n="12" />Then they understood that he had told them to be on their guard, not against the leaven of bread, but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
<verse eID="Matt.16.12" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.16.13" osisID="Matt.16.13" n="13" />On coming into the region of Caesarea Philippi, Jesus asked his disciples this question – <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Who do people say that the Son of Man is?”</q>
<verse eID="Matt.16.13" />
<verse sID="Matt.16.14" osisID="Matt.16.14" n="14" />“Some say John the Baptist,” they answered, “Others, however, say that he is Elijah, while others again say Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.”
<verse eID="Matt.16.14" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.16.15" osisID="Matt.16.15" n="15" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“But you,”</q>  he said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“who do you say that I am?”</q>
<verse eID="Matt.16.15" />
<verse sID="Matt.16.16" osisID="Matt.16.16" n="16" />To this Simon Peter answered, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”
<verse eID="Matt.16.16" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.16.17" osisID="Matt.16.17" n="17" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Blessed are you, Simon, Son of Jonah,”</q>  Jesus replied. <q who="Jesus" marker="">“For no human being has revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.</q>

<verse eID="Matt.16.19" />
<verse sID="Matt.16.20" osisID="Matt.16.20" n="20" />Then he charged his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ.
<verse eID="Matt.16.20" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.16.21" osisID="Matt.16.21" n="21" />At that time Jesus Christ began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem, and undergo much suffering at the hands of the elders, and chief priests, and teachers of the Law, and be put to death, and rise on the third day.
<verse eID="Matt.16.21" />
<verse sID="Matt.16.22" osisID="Matt.16.22" n="22" />But Peter took Jesus aside, and began to rebuke him. “Master,” he said, “please God that will never be your fate!”
<verse eID="Matt.16.22" />
<verse sID="Matt.16.23" osisID="Matt.16.23" n="23" />Jesus, however, turning to Peter, said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Out of my way, Satan! You are a hindrance to me; for you look at things, not as God does, but as person does.”</q>
<verse eID="Matt.16.23" />
<verse sID="Matt.16.24" osisID="Matt.16.24" n="24" />Then Jesus said to his disciples, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“If anyone wishes to walk in my steps, they must renounce self, and take up their cross, and follow me.</q>

<chapter sID="Matt.17" osisID="Matt.17" n="17" />
<verse sID="Matt.17.1" osisID="Matt.17.1" n="1" />Six days later, Jesus took with him Peter, and the brothers James and John, and led them up a high mountain alone.
<verse eID="Matt.17.1" />
<verse sID="Matt.17.2" osisID="Matt.17.2" n="2" />There his appearance was transformed before their eyes; his face shown like the sun, and his clothes became as white as the light.
<verse eID="Matt.17.2" />
<verse sID="Matt.17.3" osisID="Matt.17.3" n="3" />All at once Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Jesus.
<verse eID="Matt.17.3" />
<verse sID="Matt.17.4" osisID="Matt.17.4" n="4" />“Master,” exclaimed Peter, interposing, “it is good to be here; if you wish, I will make three tents here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”
<verse eID="Matt.17.4" />
<verse sID="Matt.17.5" osisID="Matt.17.5" n="5" />While he was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them, and there was a voice from the cloud that said – “This is my dearly loved son, who brings me great joy; listen to him.”
<verse eID="Matt.17.5" />
<verse sID="Matt.17.6" osisID="Matt.17.6" n="6" />The disciples, on hearing this, fell on their faces, greatly afraid.
<verse eID="Matt.17.6" />
<verse sID="Matt.17.7" osisID="Matt.17.7" n="7" />But Jesus came and touched them, saying as he did so, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Rise up, and do not be afraid.”</q>
<verse eID="Matt.17.7" />
<verse sID="Matt.17.8" osisID="Matt.17.8" n="8" />When they raised their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus himself alone.
<verse eID="Matt.17.8" />
<verse sID="Matt.17.9" osisID="Matt.17.9" n="9" />As they were going down the mountain side, Jesus gave them this warning – <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Do not speak of this vision to anyone, until the Son of Man has risen from the dead.”</q>
<verse eID="Matt.17.9" />
<verse sID="Matt.17.10" osisID="Matt.17.10" n="10" />“How is it,” his disciples asked, “that our teachers of the Law say that Elijah has to come first?”

<verse eID="Matt.17.12" />
<verse sID="Matt.17.13" osisID="Matt.17.13" n="13" />Then the disciples understood that it was of John the Baptist that he had spoken to them.
<verse eID="Matt.17.13" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.17.14" osisID="Matt.17.14" n="14" />When they came to the crowd, a man came up to Jesus, and, kneeling down before him, said,

<p>
<verse sID="Matt.20.20" osisID="Matt.20.20" n="20" />Then the mother of Zebedee’s sons came to him with her sons, bowing to the ground, and begging a favor.

<verse sID="Matt.20.24" osisID="Matt.20.24" n="24" />On hearing of this, the ten others were very indignant about the two brothers.
<verse eID="Matt.20.24" />
<verse sID="Matt.20.25" osisID="Matt.20.25" n="25" />Jesus, however, called the ten to him, and said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“The rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them as you know, and their high officials oppress them.</q>

<p>
<verse sID="Matt.21.1" osisID="Matt.21.1" n="1" />When they had almost reached Jerusalem, having come as far as Bethphage, on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent on two disciples.
<verse eID="Matt.21.1" />
<verse sID="Matt.21.2" osisID="Matt.21.2" n="2" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Go to the village facing you,”</q>  he said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“and you will immediately find an ass tethered, with a foal by her side; untie her, and lead her here for me.</q>
<verse eID="Matt.21.2" />
<verse sID="Matt.21.3" osisID="Matt.21.3" n="3" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">And, if anyone says anything to you, you are to say this – ‘The Master wants them’; and he will send them at once.”</q>
<verse eID="Matt.21.3" />
<verse sID="Matt.21.4" osisID="Matt.21.4" n="4" />This happened in fulfillment of these words in the prophet –
<verse eID="Matt.21.4" />
<verse sID="Matt.21.5" osisID="Matt.21.5" n="5" />‘Say to the people of Zion – “Your King is coming to you, gentle, and riding on an ass, and on the foal of a beast of burden.”’
<verse eID="Matt.21.5" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.21.6" osisID="Matt.21.6" n="6" />So the disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them.
<verse eID="Matt.21.6" />
<verse sID="Matt.21.7" osisID="Matt.21.7" n="7" />They led the ass and the foal back, and, when they had put their cloaks on them, he seated himself on them.
<verse eID="Matt.21.7" />
<verse sID="Matt.21.8" osisID="Matt.21.8" n="8" />The immense crowd of people spread their cloaks in the road, while some cut branches off the trees, and spread them on the road.
<verse eID="Matt.21.8" />
<verse sID="Matt.21.9" osisID="Matt.21.9" n="9" />The crowds that led the way, as well as those that followed behind, kept shouting, “God save the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! God save him from on high!”
<verse eID="Matt.21.9" />
<verse sID="Matt.21.10" osisID="Matt.21.10" n="10" />When he had entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred, and asked –
<verse eID="Matt.21.10" />
<verse sID="Matt.21.11" osisID="Matt.21.11" n="11" />“Who is this?”, to which the crowd replied – “This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth in Galilee.”
<verse eID="Matt.21.11" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.21.12" osisID="Matt.21.12" n="12" />Jesus went into the Temple Courts, and drove out all those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers, and the seats of the pigeon-dealers,
<verse eID="Matt.21.12" />
<verse sID="Matt.21.13" osisID="Matt.21.13" n="13" />and said to them, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Scripture says ‘My house will be called a house of prayer’; but you are making it a den of robbers.”</q>
<verse eID="Matt.21.13" />
<verse sID="Matt.21.14" osisID="Matt.21.14" n="14" />While he was still in the Temple Courts, some blind and some lame people came up to him, and he cured them.
<verse eID="Matt.21.14" />
<verse sID="Matt.21.15" osisID="Matt.21.15" n="15" />But, when the chief priests and the teachers of the Law saw the wonderful things that Jesus did, and the boys who were calling out in the Temple Courts “God save the Son of David!”, they were indignant,
<verse eID="Matt.21.15" />
<verse sID="Matt.21.16" osisID="Matt.21.16" n="16" />and said to him, “Do you hear what these boys are saying?”
</p>
<p>
<q who="Jesus" marker="">“Yes,”</q>  answered Jesus, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“but did you never read the words – ‘Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings you have called forth perfect praise’?”</q>
<verse eID="Matt.21.16" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.21.17" osisID="Matt.21.17" n="17" />Then he left them, and went out of the city to Bethany, and spent the night there.
<verse eID="Matt.21.17" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.21.18" osisID="Matt.21.18" n="18" />The next morning, in returning to the city, Jesus became hungry;
<verse eID="Matt.21.18" />
<verse sID="Matt.21.19" osisID="Matt.21.19" n="19" />and, noticing a solitary fig tree by the roadside, he went up to it, but found nothing on it but leaves. So he said to it, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Never again will fruit be gathered off you.”</q>  And suddenly the fruit tree withered up.
<verse eID="Matt.21.19" />
<verse sID="Matt.21.20" osisID="Matt.21.20" n="20" />When the disciples saw this, they exclaimed in astonishment, “How suddenly the fig tree withered up!”
<verse eID="Matt.21.20" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.21.21" osisID="Matt.21.21" n="21" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“I tell you,”</q>  replied Jesus, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“if you have faith, without ever a doubt, you will do what not only what has been done to the fig tree, but, even if you should say to this hill ‘Be lifted up and hurled into the sea!’ it would be done.</q>
<verse eID="Matt.21.21" />
<verse sID="Matt.21.22" osisID="Matt.21.22" n="22" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">And whatever you ask for in your prayers will, if you have faith, be granted you.”</q>
<verse eID="Matt.21.22" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.21.23" osisID="Matt.21.23" n="23" />After Jesus had come into the Temple Courts, the chief priests and the elders of the people came up to him as he was teaching, and said, “What authority have you to do these things? Who gave you this authority?”
<verse eID="Matt.21.23" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.21.24" osisID="Matt.21.24" n="24" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“I, too,”</q>  said Jesus in reply, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“will ask you one question; if you will give me an answer to it, then I, also, will tell you what authority I have to act as I do.</q>
<verse eID="Matt.21.24" />
<verse sID="Matt.21.25" osisID="Matt.21.25" n="25" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">It is about John’s baptism. What was its origin? Divine or human?” But they began arguing among themselves, “If we say ‘divine,’ he will say to us ‘Why then didn’t you believe him?’</q>
<verse eID="Matt.21.25" />
<verse sID="Matt.21.26" osisID="Matt.21.26" n="26" />But if we say ‘human,’ we are afraid of the people, for everyone regards John as a prophet.”
<verse eID="Matt.21.26" />
<verse sID="Matt.21.27" osisID="Matt.21.27" n="27" />So the answer they gave Jesus was – “We do not know.”
</p>
<p>
<q who="Jesus" marker="">“Then I,”</q>  he said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“refuse to tell you what authority I have to do these things.</q>
<verse eID="Matt.21.27" />
<verse sID="Matt.21.28" osisID="Matt.21.28" n="28" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">What do you think of this? There was a man who had two sons. He went to the elder and said ‘Go and work in the vineyard today my son.’</q>

<verse sID="Matt.21.29" osisID="Matt.21.29" n="29" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">‘Yes, sir,’ he answered; but he did not go.</q>
<verse eID="Matt.21.29" />
<verse sID="Matt.21.30" osisID="Matt.21.30" n="30" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">Then the father went to the second son, and said the same. ‘I will not,’ he answered; but afterward he was sorry and went.</q>

<verse sID="Matt.21.31" osisID="Matt.21.31" n="31" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">Which of the two sons did as his father wished?”</q>  “The second,” they said. <q who="Jesus" marker="">“I tell you,”</q>  added Jesus, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“that tax-gatherers and prostitutes are going into the kingdom of God before you.</q>
<verse eID="Matt.21.31" />
<verse sID="Matt.21.32" osisID="Matt.21.32" n="32" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">For when John came to you, walking in the path of righteousness, you did not believe him, but tax-gatherers and prostitutes did; and yet you, though you saw this, even then were not sorry, nor did you believe him.</q>

</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.21.33" osisID="Matt.21.33" n="33" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Listen to another parable. A man, who was an employer, once planted a vineyard, put a fence around it, dug a winepress in it, built a tower, and then let it out to tenants and went abroad.</q>

<verse sID="Matt.21.34" osisID="Matt.21.34" n="34" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">When the time for the grape harvest drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants, to receive his share of the produce.</q>

<verse sID="Matt.21.38" osisID="Matt.21.38" n="38" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">But the tenants, on seeing his son, said to each other ‘Here is the heir! Come, let us kill him, and get his inheritance.’</q>

<verse eID="Matt.21.41" />
<verse sID="Matt.21.42" osisID="Matt.21.42" n="42" />Then Jesus added, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Have you never read in the scriptures? – ‘The stone which the builders despised – has now itself become the corner-stone. This corner-stone has come from the Lord, and is marvelous in our eyes.’</q>

<p>
<verse sID="Matt.22.23" osisID="Matt.22.23" n="23" />That same day some Sadducees came up to Jesus, maintaining that there is no resurrection. Their question was this, –

<verse sID="Matt.26.40" osisID="Matt.26.40" n="40" />Then he came to his disciples, and found them asleep. <q who="Jesus" marker="">“What!”</q>  he said to Peter, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“could none of you watch with me for one hour?</q>
<verse eID="Matt.26.40" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.41" osisID="Matt.26.41" n="41" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">Watch and pray so that you don’t fall into temptation. True, the spirit is eager, but human nature is weak.”</q>
<verse eID="Matt.26.41" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.42" osisID="Matt.26.42" n="42" />Again, a second time, he went away, and prayed. <q who="Jesus" marker="">“My Father,”</q>  he said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“if I cannot be spared this cup, but must drink it, your will be done!”</q>
<verse eID="Matt.26.42" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.43" osisID="Matt.26.43" n="43" />And coming back again he found them asleep, for their eyes were heavy.
<verse eID="Matt.26.43" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.44" osisID="Matt.26.44" n="44" />So he left them, and went away again, and prayed a third time, again saying the same words.
<verse eID="Matt.26.44" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.45" osisID="Matt.26.45" n="45" />Then he came to the disciples, and said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Sleep on now, and rest yourselves. Look – my time is close at hand, and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of wicked people.</q>
<verse eID="Matt.26.45" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.46" osisID="Matt.26.46" n="46" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">Up, and let us be going. Look! My betrayer is close at hand.”</q>
<verse eID="Matt.26.46" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.47" osisID="Matt.26.47" n="47" />And, while he was still speaking, Judas, who was one of the Twelve, came in sight; and with him was a great crowd of people, with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and elders of the people.
<verse eID="Matt.26.47" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.48" osisID="Matt.26.48" n="48" />Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them. “The man whom I kiss,” he had said, “will be the one; arrest him.”
<verse eID="Matt.26.48" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.49" osisID="Matt.26.49" n="49" />So he went up to Jesus at once, and exclaimed, “Welcome, Rabbi!” and kissed him;
<verse eID="Matt.26.49" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.50" osisID="Matt.26.50" n="50" />at which Jesus said to him, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Friend, do what you have come for.”</q>  The men went up, seized Jesus, and arrested him.
<verse eID="Matt.26.50" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.51" osisID="Matt.26.51" n="51" />Suddenly one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and striking the high priest’s servant, cut off his ear.
<verse eID="Matt.26.51" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.52" osisID="Matt.26.52" n="52" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Sheathe your sword,”</q>  Jesus said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“for all who draw the sword will be put to the sword.</q>
<verse eID="Matt.26.52" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.53" osisID="Matt.26.53" n="53" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">Do you think that I cannot ask my Father for help, when he would at once send to my aid more than twelve legions of angels?</q>
<verse eID="Matt.26.53" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.54" osisID="Matt.26.54" n="54" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">But in that case how would the scriptures be fulfilled, which say that this must be?”</q>
<verse eID="Matt.26.54" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.55" osisID="Matt.26.55" n="55" />Jesus at the same time said to the crowds, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Have you come out, as if after a robber, with swords and clubs, to take me? I have sat teaching day after day in the Temple Courts, and yet you did not arrest me.”</q>
<verse eID="Matt.26.55" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.56" osisID="Matt.26.56" n="56" />The whole of this occurred in fulfillment of the Prophetic scriptures. Then the disciples all forsook him and fled.
<verse eID="Matt.26.56" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.26.57" osisID="Matt.26.57" n="57" />Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the Law and elders had assembled.
<verse eID="Matt.26.57" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.58" osisID="Matt.26.58" n="58" />Peter followed him at a distance as far as the courtyard of the offices, to see the end.
<verse eID="Matt.26.58" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.59" osisID="Matt.26.59" n="59" />Meanwhile the chief priests and the whole of the High Council were trying to get such false evidence against Jesus, as would warrant putting him to death,
<verse eID="Matt.26.59" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.60" osisID="Matt.26.60" n="60" />but they did not find any, although many came forward with false evidence. Later on, however, two men came forward and said,
<verse eID="Matt.26.60" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.61" osisID="Matt.26.61" n="61" />“This man said ‘I am able to destroy the Temple of God, and to build it in three days.’”
<verse eID="Matt.26.61" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.62" osisID="Matt.26.62" n="62" />Then the high priest stood up, and said to Jesus, “Have you no answer? What is this evidence which these men are giving against you?”
<verse eID="Matt.26.62" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.63" osisID="Matt.26.63" n="63" />But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, “I order you, by the living God, to tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God.”
<verse eID="Matt.26.63" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.26.64" osisID="Matt.26.64" n="64" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“It is true,”</q>  Jesus answered, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Moreover I tell you all that hereafter you will see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of the Almighty, and coming on the clouds of the heavens.”</q>
<verse eID="Matt.26.64" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.65" osisID="Matt.26.65" n="65" />Then the high priest tore his robes. “This is blasphemy!” he exclaimed. “Why do we want any more witnesses? You have just heard his blasphemy!
<verse eID="Matt.26.65" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.66" osisID="Matt.26.66" n="66" />What is your decision?” They answered, “He deserves death.”
<verse eID="Matt.26.66" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.67" osisID="Matt.26.67" n="67" />Then they spat in his face, and struck him, while others dealt blows at him, saying as they did so,
<verse eID="Matt.26.67" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.68" osisID="Matt.26.68" n="68" />“Now play the prophet for us, you Christ! Who was it that struck you?”
<verse eID="Matt.26.68" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.69" osisID="Matt.26.69" n="69" />Peter, meanwhile, was sitting outside in the courtyard; and a maidservant came up to him, and exclaimed, “Why, you were with Jesus the Galilean!”
<verse eID="Matt.26.69" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.70" osisID="Matt.26.70" n="70" />But Peter denied it before them all. “I do not know what you mean,” he replied.
<verse eID="Matt.26.70" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.71" osisID="Matt.26.71" n="71" />When he had gone out into the gateway, another maid saw him, and said to those who were there, “This man was with Jesus of Nazareth!”
<verse eID="Matt.26.71" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.72" osisID="Matt.26.72" n="72" />Again he denied it with an oath, “I do not know the man!”
<verse eID="Matt.26.72" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.73" osisID="Matt.26.73" n="73" />But soon afterward those who were standing by came up and said to Peter, “You also are certainly one of them; why, even your way of speaking proves it!”
<verse eID="Matt.26.73" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.74" osisID="Matt.26.74" n="74" />Then Peter said, “I swear that I do not know the man! May God punish me if I am lying!” At that moment a cock crowed;
<verse eID="Matt.26.74" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.75" osisID="Matt.26.75" n="75" />and Peter remembered the words which Jesus had said – <q who="Jesus" marker="">‘Before a cock has crowed, you will disown me three times’;</q>  and he went outside, and wept bitterly.
<verse eID="Matt.26.75" />
<chapter eID="Matt.26" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Matt.27" osisID="Matt.27" n="27" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.1" osisID="Matt.27.1" n="1" />At daybreak all the chief priests and the elders of the people consulted together against Jesus, to bring about his death.
<verse eID="Matt.27.1" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.2" osisID="Matt.27.2" n="2" />They put him in chains and led him away, and gave him up to the Roman Governor, Pilate.
<verse eID="Matt.27.2" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.3" osisID="Matt.27.3" n="3" />Then Judas, who betrayed him, seeing that Jesus was condemned, repented of what he had done, and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
<verse eID="Matt.27.3" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.4" osisID="Matt.27.4" n="4" />“I did wrong in betraying a good man to his death,” he said. “What has that to do with us?” they replied. “You must see to that yourself.”
<verse eID="Matt.27.4" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.5" osisID="Matt.27.5" n="5" />Judas flung down the pieces of silver in the Temple, and left; and went away and hanged himself.
<verse eID="Matt.27.5" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.6" osisID="Matt.27.6" n="6" />The chief priests took the pieces of silver, but they said, “We must not put them into the Temple treasury, because they are blood-money.”
<verse eID="Matt.27.6" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.7" osisID="Matt.27.7" n="7" />So, after consultation, they bought with them the ‘Potter’s Field’ for a burial-ground for foreigners;
<verse eID="Matt.27.7" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.8" osisID="Matt.27.8" n="8" />and that is why that field is called the ‘Field of Blood’ to this very day.
<verse eID="Matt.27.8" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.9" osisID="Matt.27.9" n="9" />Then it was that these words spoken by the prophet Jeremiah were fulfilled – ‘They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him who was valued, whom some of the people of Israel valued,
<verse eID="Matt.27.9" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.10" osisID="Matt.27.10" n="10" />and gave them for the Potter’s field, as the Lord commanded me.’
<verse eID="Matt.27.10" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.11" osisID="Matt.27.11" n="11" />Meanwhile Jesus was brought before the Roman Governor. “Are you the king of the Jews?” asked the Governor. <q who="Jesus" marker="">“It is true,”</q>  answered Jesus.
<verse eID="Matt.27.11" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.12" osisID="Matt.27.12" n="12" />While charges were being brought against him by the chief priests and elders, Jesus made no reply.
<verse eID="Matt.27.12" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.13" osisID="Matt.27.13" n="13" />Then Pilate said to him, “Don’t you hear how many accusations they are making against you?”
<verse eID="Matt.27.13" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.14" osisID="Matt.27.14" n="14" />Yet Jesus made no reply – not even a single word; at which the Governor was greatly astonished.
<verse eID="Matt.27.14" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.15" osisID="Matt.27.15" n="15" />Now, at the feast, the Governor was accustomed to grant the people the release of any one prisoner whom they might choose.
<verse eID="Matt.27.15" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.16" osisID="Matt.27.16" n="16" />At that time they had a notorious prisoner called Barabbas.
<verse eID="Matt.27.16" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.17" osisID="Matt.27.17" n="17" />So, when the people had collected, Pilate said to them, “Which do you wish me to release for you? Barabbas? Or Jesus who is called ‘Christ’?”
<verse eID="Matt.27.17" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.18" osisID="Matt.27.18" n="18" />For he knew that it was out of jealousy that they had given Jesus up to him.
<verse eID="Matt.27.18" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.19" osisID="Matt.27.19" n="19" />While he was still on the Bench, his wife sent this message to him – “Do not have anything to do with that good man, for I have been very unhappy today in a dream because of him.”
<verse eID="Matt.27.19" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.20" osisID="Matt.27.20" n="20" />But the chief priests and elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas, and to kill Jesus.
<verse eID="Matt.27.20" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.21" osisID="Matt.27.21" n="21" />The Governor, however, said to them, “Which of these two do you wish me to release for you?”
</p>
<p>
“Barabbas,” they answered.
<verse eID="Matt.27.21" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.22" osisID="Matt.27.22" n="22" />“What then,” Pilate asked, “should I do with Jesus who is called ‘Christ?’” “Crucify him,” they all replied.
<verse eID="Matt.27.22" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.23" osisID="Matt.27.23" n="23" />“Why, what harm has he done?” he asked. But they kept shouting furiously, “Crucify him!”
<verse eID="Matt.27.23" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.24" osisID="Matt.27.24" n="24" />When Pilate saw that his efforts were unavailing, but that, on the contrary, a riot was beginning, he took some water, and washed his hands in the sight of the crowd, saying as he did so, “I am not answerable for this bloodshed; you must see to it yourselves.”
<verse eID="Matt.27.24" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.25" osisID="Matt.27.25" n="25" />And all the people answered, “His blood be on our heads and on our children’s!”
<verse eID="Matt.27.25" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.26" osisID="Matt.27.26" n="26" />The Pilate released Barabbas to them; but Jesus he scourged, and gave him up to be crucified.
<verse eID="Matt.27.26" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.27.27" osisID="Matt.27.27" n="27" />After that, the Governor’s soldiers took Jesus with them into the Government house, and gathered the whole garrison around him.
<verse eID="Matt.27.27" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.28" osisID="Matt.27.28" n="28" />They stripped him, and put on him a red military cloak,
<verse eID="Matt.27.28" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.29" osisID="Matt.27.29" n="29" />and having twisted some thorns into a crown, put it on his head, and a rod in his right hand, and then, going down on their knees before him, they mocked him. “Long life to you, king of the Jews!” they said.
<verse eID="Matt.27.29" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.30" osisID="Matt.27.30" n="30" />They spat at him and, taking the rod, kept striking him on the head;
<verse eID="Matt.27.30" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.31" osisID="Matt.27.31" n="31" />and, when they had left off mocking him, they took off the military cloak, and put his own clothes on him, and led him away to be crucified.
<verse eID="Matt.27.31" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.27.32" osisID="Matt.27.32" n="32" />As they were on their way out, they came upon a man from Cyrene of the name of Simon; and they compelled him to go with them to carry the cross.
<verse eID="Matt.27.32" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.33" osisID="Matt.27.33" n="33" />On reaching a place named Golgotha (a place named from its likeness to a skull),
<verse eID="Matt.27.33" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.34" osisID="Matt.27.34" n="34" />they gave him some wine to drink which had been mixed with gall; but after tasting it, Jesus refused to drink it.
<verse eID="Matt.27.34" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.35" osisID="Matt.27.35" n="35" />When they had crucified him, they divided his clothes among them by casting lots.
<verse eID="Matt.27.35" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.36" osisID="Matt.27.36" n="36" />Then they sat down, and kept watch over him there.
<verse eID="Matt.27.36" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.37" osisID="Matt.27.37" n="37" />Above his head they fixed the accusation against him written out – ‘THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.’
<verse eID="Matt.27.37" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.38" osisID="Matt.27.38" n="38" />At the same time two robbers were crucified with him, one on the right, the other on the left.
<verse eID="Matt.27.38" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.39" osisID="Matt.27.39" n="39" />The passers-by railed at him, shaking their heads as they said,
<verse eID="Matt.27.39" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.40" osisID="Matt.27.40" n="40" />“You who ‘destroy the Temple and build one in three days,’ save yourself! If you are God’s Son, come down from the cross!”
<verse eID="Matt.27.40" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.41" osisID="Matt.27.41" n="41" />In the same way the chief priests, with the Teaches of the Law and elders, said in mockery,
<verse eID="Matt.27.41" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.42" osisID="Matt.27.42" n="42" />“He saved others, but he cannot save himself! He is the ‘king of Israel’! Why doesn’t he come down from the cross now, then we will believe in him.
<verse eID="Matt.27.42" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.43" osisID="Matt.27.43" n="43" />He has trusted in God; if God wants him, let him deliver him now; for he said ‘I am God’s Son.’”
<verse eID="Matt.27.43" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.44" osisID="Matt.27.44" n="44" />Even the robbers, who were crucified with him, insulted him in the same way.
<verse eID="Matt.27.44" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.45" osisID="Matt.27.45" n="45" />After midday a darkness came over all the country, lasting until three in the afternoon.
<verse eID="Matt.27.45" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.46" osisID="Matt.27.46" n="46" />About three Jesus called out loudly, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Eloi, Eloi, lema sabacthani”</q>  – that is to say, <q who="Jesus" marker="">‘My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?’</q>
<verse eID="Matt.27.46" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.47" osisID="Matt.27.47" n="47" />Some of those standing by heard this, and said, “The man is calling for Elijah!”
<verse eID="Matt.27.47" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.48" osisID="Matt.27.48" n="48" />One of them immediately ran and took a sponge, and, filling it with common wine, put it on the end of a rod, and offered it to him to drink.
<verse eID="Matt.27.48" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.49" osisID="Matt.27.49" n="49" />But the rest said, “Wait and let us see if Elijah is coming to save him.”<note placement="foot"><reference type="annotateRef">27:49 </reference>Some later manuscripts add: However another man took a spear, and pierced his side; and water and blood flowed from it.</note>
<verse eID="Matt.27.49" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.50" osisID="Matt.27.50" n="50" />But Jesus, uttering another loud cry, gave up his spirit.
<verse eID="Matt.27.50" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.51" osisID="Matt.27.51" n="51" />Suddenly the Temple curtain was torn in two from top to bottom, the earth shook, the rocks were torn asunder,
<verse eID="Matt.27.51" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.52" osisID="Matt.27.52" n="52" />the tombs opened, and the bodies of many of God’s people who had fallen asleep rose,
<verse eID="Matt.27.52" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.53" osisID="Matt.27.53" n="53" />and they, leaving their tombs, went, after the resurrection of Jesus, into the Holy City, and appeared to many people.
<verse eID="Matt.27.53" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.54" osisID="Matt.27.54" n="54" />The Roman captain, and the men with him who were watching Jesus, on seeing the earthquake and all that was happening, became greatly frightened and exclaimed, “This must indeed have been God’s Son!”
<verse eID="Matt.27.54" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.55" osisID="Matt.27.55" n="55" />There were many women there, watching from a distance, who had accompanied Jesus from Galilee and had been attending on him.
<verse eID="Matt.27.55" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.56" osisID="Matt.27.56" n="56" />Among them were Mary of Magdala, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee’s sons.
<verse eID="Matt.27.56" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.27.57" osisID="Matt.27.57" n="57" />When evening had fallen, there came a rich man belonging to Ramah, named Joseph, who had himself become a disciple of Jesus.
<verse eID="Matt.27.57" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.58" osisID="Matt.27.58" n="58" />He went to see Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. Pilate ordered it to be given him.
<verse eID="Matt.27.58" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.59" osisID="Matt.27.59" n="59" />So Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen sheet,
<verse eID="Matt.27.59" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.60" osisID="Matt.27.60" n="60" />and laid it in his newly made tomb which he had cut in the rock; and, before he left, he rolled a great stone against the entrance of the tomb.
<verse eID="Matt.27.60" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.61" osisID="Matt.27.61" n="61" />Mary of Magdala and the other Mary remained behind, sitting in front of the grave.
<verse eID="Matt.27.61" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.27.62" osisID="Matt.27.62" n="62" />The next day – that is, the day following the Preparation-day – the chief priests and Pharisees came in a body to Pilate, and said,
<verse eID="Matt.27.62" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.63" osisID="Matt.27.63" n="63" />“Sir, we remember that, during his lifetime, that impostor said <q who="Jesus" marker="">‘I will rise after three days.’</q>
<verse eID="Matt.27.63" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.64" osisID="Matt.27.64" n="64" />So order the tomb to be made secure until the third day. Otherwise his disciples may come and steal him, and then say to the people ‘He has risen from the dead,’ when the latest imposture will be worse than the first.”
<verse eID="Matt.27.64" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.27.65" osisID="Matt.27.65" n="65" />“You may have a guard,” was Pilate’s reply. “Go and make the tomb as secure as you can.”
<verse eID="Matt.27.65" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.66" osisID="Matt.27.66" n="66" />So they went and made the tomb secure, by sealing the stone, in presence of the guard.

<!-- s --><title>The Risen Life</title>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.28.1" osisID="Matt.28.1" n="1" />After the Sabbath, as the first day of the week began to dawn, Mary of Magdala and the other Mary had gone to look at the grave,
<verse eID="Matt.28.1" />
<verse sID="Matt.28.2" osisID="Matt.28.2" n="2" />when suddenly a great earthquake occurred. For an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled away the stone, and seated himself on it.
<verse eID="Matt.28.2" />
<verse sID="Matt.28.3" osisID="Matt.28.3" n="3" />His appearance was as dazzling as lightning, and his clothing was as white as snow;
<verse eID="Matt.28.3" />
<verse sID="Matt.28.4" osisID="Matt.28.4" n="4" />and, in their terror of him, the men on guard trembled violently and became like dead men.
<verse eID="Matt.28.4" />
<verse sID="Matt.28.5" osisID="Matt.28.5" n="5" />But the angel, addressing the women, said, “You need not be afraid. I know that it is Jesus, who was crucified, for whom you are looking.
<verse eID="Matt.28.5" />
<verse sID="Matt.28.6" osisID="Matt.28.6" n="6" />He is not here; for he has risen, as he said he would. Come, and see the place where he was lying;
<verse eID="Matt.28.6" />
<verse sID="Matt.28.7" osisID="Matt.28.7" n="7" />and then go quickly and say to his disciples ‘He has risen from the dead, and is going before you into Galilee; there you will see him.’ Remember, I have told you.”
<verse eID="Matt.28.7" />
<verse sID="Matt.28.8" osisID="Matt.28.8" n="8" />They left the tomb quickly, in awe and great joy, and ran to tell the news to the disciples.
<verse eID="Matt.28.8" />
<verse sID="Matt.28.9" osisID="Matt.28.9" n="9" />Suddenly Jesus met them. <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Welcome!”</q>  he said. The women went up to him, and clasped his feet, bowing to the ground before him. Then Jesus said to them,
<verse eID="Matt.28.9" />
<verse sID="Matt.28.10" osisID="Matt.28.10" n="10" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Do not be afraid; go and tell my brothers and sisters to set out for Galilee, and they will see me there.”</q>
<verse eID="Matt.28.10" />
<verse sID="Matt.28.11" osisID="Matt.28.11" n="11" />While they were still on their way, some of the guard came into the city, and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.
<verse eID="Matt.28.11" />
<verse sID="Matt.28.12" osisID="Matt.28.12" n="12" />So they and the elders met and, after holding a consultation, gave a large sum of money to the soldiers,
<verse eID="Matt.28.12" />
<verse sID="Matt.28.13" osisID="Matt.28.13" n="13" />and told them to say that his disciples came in the night, and stole him while they were asleep;
<verse eID="Matt.28.13" />
<verse sID="Matt.28.14" osisID="Matt.28.14" n="14" />“And should this matter come before the Governor,” they added, “we will satisfy him, and see that you have nothing to fear.”
<verse eID="Matt.28.14" />
<verse sID="Matt.28.15" osisID="Matt.28.15" n="15" />So the soldiers took the money, and did as they were instructed. This story spread widely; the people of Judea still tell it today.
<verse eID="Matt.28.15" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Matt.28.16" osisID="Matt.28.16" n="16" />The eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus told them to meet him;
<verse eID="Matt.28.16" />
<verse sID="Matt.28.17" osisID="Matt.28.17" n="17" />and, when they saw him, they bowed to the ground before him; although some felt doubtful.
<verse eID="Matt.28.17" />
<verse sID="Matt.28.18" osisID="Matt.28.18" n="18" />Then Jesus came up, and spoke to them, saying, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“All authority in heaven and on the earth has been given to me.</q>
<verse eID="Matt.28.18" />
<verse sID="Matt.28.19" osisID="Matt.28.19" n="19" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">Therefore go and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,</q>
<verse eID="Matt.28.19" />
<verse sID="Matt.28.20" osisID="Matt.28.20" n="20" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">and teaching them to lay to heart all the commands that I have given you; and, remember, I myself am with you every day until the close of the age.”</q>

<!-- s --><title>The Preparation</title>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.1.1" osisID="Mark.1.1" n="1" />The beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ.
<verse eID="Mark.1.1" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.1.2" osisID="Mark.1.2" n="2" />It is said in the prophet Isaiah –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘I am sending my messenger ahead of you;</l>
<l level="2">he will prepare your way. <verse eID="Mark.1.2" /></l>
<l level="1">
<verse sID="Mark.1.3" osisID="Mark.1.3" n="3" />The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness:</l>
<l level="2">“Prepare the road for the Lord,</l>
<l level="3">make a straight path for him.”’ <verse eID="Mark.1.3" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Mark.1.4" osisID="Mark.1.4" n="4" />John the Baptizer appeared in the wilderness, proclaiming a baptism on repentance, for the forgiveness of sins.
<verse eID="Mark.1.4" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.5" osisID="Mark.1.5" n="5" />The whole of Judea, as well as all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, went out to him; and they were baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.
<verse eID="Mark.1.5" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.1.6" osisID="Mark.1.6" n="6" />John wore clothes made of camels’ hair, with a leather strap around his waist, and lived on locusts and wild honey;
<verse eID="Mark.1.6" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.7" osisID="Mark.1.7" n="7" />and he proclaimed – “After me is coming someone more powerful than I am, and I am not fit even to stoop down and unfasten his sandals.
<verse eID="Mark.1.7" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.8" osisID="Mark.1.8" n="8" />I have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”
<verse eID="Mark.1.8" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.1.9" osisID="Mark.1.9" n="9" />Now about that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
<verse eID="Mark.1.9" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.10" osisID="Mark.1.10" n="10" />Just as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens split open and the Spirit coming down to him like a dove,
<verse eID="Mark.1.10" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.11" osisID="Mark.1.11" n="11" />and from the heavens came a voice – “You are my dearly loved son; you bring me great joy.”
<verse eID="Mark.1.11" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.1.12" osisID="Mark.1.12" n="12" />Immediately afterward the Spirit drove Jesus out into the wilderness;
<verse eID="Mark.1.12" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.13" osisID="Mark.1.13" n="13" />and he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan, and among the wild beasts, while the angels helped him.
</p>
<verse eID="Mark.1.13" />
<!-- s --><title>The Work in Galilee</title>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.1.14" osisID="Mark.1.14" n="14" />After John had been arrested, Jesus went to Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God –
<verse eID="Mark.1.14" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.15" osisID="Mark.1.15" n="15" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“The time has come, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent, and believe the good news.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.1.15" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.1.16" osisID="Mark.1.16" n="16" />As Jesus was going along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net in the sea, for they were fishermen.
<verse eID="Mark.1.16" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.17" osisID="Mark.1.17" n="17" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Come and follow me,”</q>  Jesus said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“and I will teach you to fish for people.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.1.17" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.18" osisID="Mark.1.18" n="18" />They left their nets at once, and followed him.
<verse eID="Mark.1.18" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.1.19" osisID="Mark.1.19" n="19" />Going on a little further, he saw James, Zebedee’s son, and his brother John, who were in their boat mending the nets.
<verse eID="Mark.1.19" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.20" osisID="Mark.1.20" n="20" />Jesus called them at once, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the crew, and went after him.
<verse eID="Mark.1.20" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.1.21" osisID="Mark.1.21" n="21" />They walked to Capernaum. On the next Sabbath Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.
<verse eID="Mark.1.21" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.22" osisID="Mark.1.22" n="22" />The people were amazed at his teaching, for he taught them like one who had authority, and not like the teachers of the Law.
<verse eID="Mark.1.22" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.23" osisID="Mark.1.23" n="23" />Now there was in their synagogue at the time a man under the power of a foul spirit, who called out,
<verse eID="Mark.1.23" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.24" osisID="Mark.1.24" n="24" />“What do you want with us, Jesus the Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are – the Holy One of God!”
<verse eID="Mark.1.24" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.25" osisID="Mark.1.25" n="25" />But Jesus rebuked the spirit, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Be silent! Come out from him.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.1.25" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.26" osisID="Mark.1.26" n="26" />The foul spirit threw the man into a fit, and with a loud cry came out from him.
<verse eID="Mark.1.26" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.27" osisID="Mark.1.27" n="27" />They were all so amazed that they kept asking each other, “What is this? What is this, a new kind of teaching? He gives his commands with authority even to the foul spirits, and they obey him!”
<verse eID="Mark.1.27" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.28" osisID="Mark.1.28" n="28" />His fame spread at once in all directions, through the whole region of Galilee.
<verse eID="Mark.1.28" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.1.29" osisID="Mark.1.29" n="29" />As soon as they had left the synagogue, they went to the house of Simon and Andrew, along with James and John.
<verse eID="Mark.1.29" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.30" osisID="Mark.1.30" n="30" />Now Simon’s mother-in-law was lying ill with a fever, and they at once told Jesus about her.
<verse eID="Mark.1.30" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.31" osisID="Mark.1.31" n="31" />Jesus went up to her and, grasping her hand, raised her up; the fever left her, and she began to take care of them.
<verse eID="Mark.1.31" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.1.32" osisID="Mark.1.32" n="32" />In the evening, after sunset, the people brought to Jesus all who were ill or possessed by demons;
<verse eID="Mark.1.32" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.33" osisID="Mark.1.33" n="33" />and the whole city was gathered around the door.
<verse eID="Mark.1.33" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.34" osisID="Mark.1.34" n="34" />Jesus cured many who were ill with various diseases, and drove out many demons, and would not permit them to speak, because they knew him to be the Christ.
<verse eID="Mark.1.34" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.1.35" osisID="Mark.1.35" n="35" />In the morning, long before daylight, Jesus got up and went out to a lonely spot, and there he began to pray.
<verse eID="Mark.1.35" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.36" osisID="Mark.1.36" n="36" />But Simon and his companions went out searching for him;
<verse eID="Mark.1.36" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.37" osisID="Mark.1.37" n="37" />and, when they found him, they exclaimed, “Everyone is looking for you!”
<verse eID="Mark.1.37" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.38" osisID="Mark.1.38" n="38" />But Jesus said to them, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Let us go somewhere else, into the country towns nearby so that I can make my proclamation in them also; for that was why I came.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.1.38" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.39" osisID="Mark.1.39" n="39" />And he went about making his proclamation in their synagogues all through Galilee, and driving out the demons.
<verse eID="Mark.1.39" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.1.40" osisID="Mark.1.40" n="40" />One day a leper came to Jesus and, falling on his knees, begged him for help. “If only you are willing,” he said, “you are able to make me clean.”
<verse eID="Mark.1.40" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.41" osisID="Mark.1.41" n="41" />Moved with compassion, Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying as he did so, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“I am willing; become clean.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.1.41" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.42" osisID="Mark.1.42" n="42" />Instantly the leprosy left the man, and he became clean;
<verse eID="Mark.1.42" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.43" osisID="Mark.1.43" n="43" />and then Jesus, after sternly warning him, immediately sent him away, and said to him,
<verse eID="Mark.1.43" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.44" osisID="Mark.1.44" n="44" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Be careful not to say anything to anyone; but go and show yourself to the priest, and make the offerings for your cleansing directed by Moses, as evidence of your cure.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.1.44" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.45" osisID="Mark.1.45" n="45" />The man, however, went away, and began to speak about it publicly, and to spread the story so widely, that Jesus could no longer go openly into a town, but stayed outside in lonely places; and people came to him from every direction.
<verse eID="Mark.1.45" />
<chapter eID="Mark.1" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Mark.2" osisID="Mark.2" n="2" />
<verse sID="Mark.2.1" osisID="Mark.2.1" n="1" />Some days later, when Jesus came back to Capernaum, the news spread that he was in a house there;
<verse eID="Mark.2.1" />
<verse sID="Mark.2.2" osisID="Mark.2.2" n="2" />and so many people collected together, that after a while there was no room for them even around the door; and he began to tell them his message.
<verse eID="Mark.2.2" />
<verse sID="Mark.2.3" osisID="Mark.2.3" n="3" />Some people came, bringing to him a paralyzed man, who was being carried by four of them.
<verse eID="Mark.2.3" />
<verse sID="Mark.2.4" osisID="Mark.2.4" n="4" />Being, however, unable to get him near to Jesus, owing to the crowd, they removed the roofing above Jesus; and, when they had made an opening, they let down the mat on which the paralyzed man was lying.
<verse eID="Mark.2.4" />
<verse sID="Mark.2.5" osisID="Mark.2.5" n="5" />When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the man, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Child, your sins are forgiven.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.2.5" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.2.6" osisID="Mark.2.6" n="6" />But some of the teachers of the Law who were sitting there were debating in their minds,
<verse eID="Mark.2.6" />
<verse sID="Mark.2.7" osisID="Mark.2.7" n="7" />“Why does this man speak like this? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins except God?”
<verse eID="Mark.2.7" />
<verse sID="Mark.2.8" osisID="Mark.2.8" n="8" />Jesus, at once intuitively aware that they were debating with themselves in this way, said to them, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Why are you debating in your minds about this?</q>
<verse eID="Mark.2.8" />
<verse sID="Mark.2.9" osisID="Mark.2.9" n="9" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">Which is easier? – to say to the paralyzed man, ‘Your sins are forgiven’? Or to say ‘Get up, and take up your mat, and walk’?</q>
<verse eID="Mark.2.9" />
<verse sID="Mark.2.10" osisID="Mark.2.10" n="10" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">But so you may know that the Son of Man has power to forgive sins on earth”</q>  – here he said to the paralyzed man –
<verse eID="Mark.2.10" />
<verse sID="Mark.2.11" osisID="Mark.2.11" n="11" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“To you I say, Get up, take up your mat, and return to your home.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.2.11" />
<verse sID="Mark.2.12" osisID="Mark.2.12" n="12" />The man got up, and immediately took up his mat, and went out before them all; at which they were amazed, and, as they praised God, they said, “We have never seen anything like this!”
<verse eID="Mark.2.12" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.2.13" osisID="Mark.2.13" n="13" />Jesus went out again to the sea; and all the people came to him, and he taught them.
<verse eID="Mark.2.13" />
<verse sID="Mark.2.14" osisID="Mark.2.14" n="14" />As he went along, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting in the tax office, and said to him, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Follow me.”</q>  Levi got up and followed him.
<verse eID="Mark.2.14" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.2.15" osisID="Mark.2.15" n="15" />Later on he was in his house having dinner, and a number of tax-gatherers and outcasts took their places at the table with Jesus and his disciples; for many of them were following him.
<verse eID="Mark.2.15" />
<verse sID="Mark.2.16" osisID="Mark.2.16" n="16" />When the teachers of the Law belonging to the party of the Pharisees saw that he was eating in the company of such people, they said to his disciples, “Why does he eat with the tax-gatherers and outcasts?”
<verse eID="Mark.2.16" />
<verse sID="Mark.2.17" osisID="Mark.2.17" n="17" />Hearing this, Jesus said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“It is not those who are healthy who need a doctor, but those who are ill. I did not come to call the religious, but the outcast.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.2.17" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.2.18" osisID="Mark.2.18" n="18" />Now John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, and people came and asked Jesus, “Why is it that John’s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, while yours do not?”
<verse eID="Mark.2.18" />
<verse sID="Mark.2.19" osisID="Mark.2.19" n="19" />Jesus answered, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Can the groom’s friends fast, while the groom is with them? As long as they have the groom with them, they cannot fast.</q>
<verse eID="Mark.2.19" />
<verse sID="Mark.2.20" osisID="Mark.2.20" n="20" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">But the days will come, when the groom will be taken away from them, and they will fast then – when that day comes.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.2.20" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.2.21" osisID="Mark.2.21" n="21" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“No one ever sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; if they do, the patch tears away from it – the new from the old – and a worse tear is made.</q>
<verse eID="Mark.2.21" />
<verse sID="Mark.2.22" osisID="Mark.2.22" n="22" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">And no one ever puts new wine into old wine-skins; if they do, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the skins are lost. But new wine is put into fresh skins.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.2.22" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.2.23" osisID="Mark.2.23" n="23" />One Sabbath, as Jesus was walking through the cornfields, his disciples began to pick the ears of wheat as they went along.
<verse eID="Mark.2.23" />
<verse sID="Mark.2.24" osisID="Mark.2.24" n="24" />“Look!” the Pharisees said to him, “why are they doing what is not allowed on the Sabbath?”
<verse eID="Mark.2.24" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.2.25" osisID="Mark.2.25" n="25" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Have you never read,”</q>  answered Jesus, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“what David did when he was in need and hungry, he and his companions –</q>
<verse eID="Mark.2.25" />
<verse sID="Mark.2.26" osisID="Mark.2.26" n="26" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">how he went into the house of God, in the time of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the consecrated bread, which only the priests are allowed to eat, and gave some to his comrades as well?”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.2.26" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.2.27" osisID="Mark.2.27" n="27" />Then Jesus added, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“The Sabbath was made for people, and not people for the Sabbath;</q>
<verse eID="Mark.2.27" />
<verse sID="Mark.2.28" osisID="Mark.2.28" n="28" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">so the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.2.28" />

</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Mark.3" osisID="Mark.3" n="3" />
<verse sID="Mark.3.1" osisID="Mark.3.1" n="1" />On another occasion Jesus went in to a synagogue, where there was a man whose hand was withered.
<verse eID="Mark.3.1" />
<verse sID="Mark.3.2" osisID="Mark.3.2" n="2" />And they watched Jesus closely, to see if he would cure the man on the Sabbath, so that they might have a charge to bring against him.
<verse eID="Mark.3.2" />
<verse sID="Mark.3.3" osisID="Mark.3.3" n="3" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Stand out in the middle,”</q>  Jesus said to the man with the withered hand;
<verse eID="Mark.3.3" />
<verse sID="Mark.3.4" osisID="Mark.3.4" n="4" />and to the people he said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Is it allowable to do good at the Sabbath – or harm? To save a life, or destroy it?”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.3.4" />
<verse sID="Mark.3.5" osisID="Mark.3.5" n="5" />As they remained silent, Jesus looked around at them in anger, grieving at the hardness of their hearts, and said to the man, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Stretch out your hand.”</q>  The man stretched it out; and his hand had become sound.
<verse eID="Mark.3.5" />
<verse sID="Mark.3.6" osisID="Mark.3.6" n="6" />Immediately on leaving the synagogue, the Pharisees and the Herodians united in laying a plot against Jesus, to put him to death.
<verse eID="Mark.3.6" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.3.7" osisID="Mark.3.7" n="7" />Then Jesus went away with his disciples to the sea, followed by a great number of people from Galilee.
<verse eID="Mark.3.7" />
<verse sID="Mark.3.8" osisID="Mark.3.8" n="8" />A great number, hearing of all that he was doing, came to him from Judea, from Jerusalem, from Edom, from beyond the Jordan, and from the country around Tyre and Sidon.
<verse eID="Mark.3.8" />
<verse sID="Mark.3.9" osisID="Mark.3.9" n="9" />So Jesus told his disciples to keep a small boat close by, so that the crowd would not crush him.
<verse eID="Mark.3.9" />
<verse sID="Mark.3.10" osisID="Mark.3.10" n="10" />For he had cured many of them, and so people kept crowding around him, so all who were sick might touch him.
<verse eID="Mark.3.10" />
<verse sID="Mark.3.11" osisID="Mark.3.11" n="11" />The foul spirits, too, whenever they caught sight of him, flung themselves down before him, and screamed out, “You are the Son of God”!
<verse eID="Mark.3.11" />
<verse sID="Mark.3.12" osisID="Mark.3.12" n="12" />But he repeatedly warned them not to make him known.
<verse eID="Mark.3.12" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.3.13" osisID="Mark.3.13" n="13" />Jesus made his way up the hill, and called those whom he wished; and they went to him.
<verse eID="Mark.3.13" />
<verse sID="Mark.3.14" osisID="Mark.3.14" n="14" />He appointed twelve – whom he also named ‘apostles’ – so that they might be with him, and that he might send them out as his messengers, to preach,
<verse eID="Mark.3.14" />
<verse sID="Mark.3.15" osisID="Mark.3.15" n="15" />and with power to drive out demons.
<verse eID="Mark.3.15" />
<verse sID="Mark.3.16" osisID="Mark.3.16" n="16" />So he appointed the Twelve – Peter (which was the name that Jesus gave to Simon),
<verse eID="Mark.3.16" />
<verse sID="Mark.3.17" osisID="Mark.3.17" n="17" />James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John (to whom he gave the name of Boanerges, which means the Thunderers),
<verse eID="Mark.3.17" />
<verse sID="Mark.3.18" osisID="Mark.3.18" n="18" />Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot,
<verse eID="Mark.3.18" />
<verse sID="Mark.3.19" osisID="Mark.3.19" n="19" />and Judas Iscariot, the man who betrayed him.
<verse eID="Mark.3.19" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.3.20" osisID="Mark.3.20" n="20" />Jesus went into a house; and again a crowd collected, so that they were not even able to eat their food.
<verse eID="Mark.3.20" />
<verse sID="Mark.3.21" osisID="Mark.3.21" n="21" />When his relatives heard of it, they went to take charge of him, for they said that he was out of his mind.
<verse eID="Mark.3.21" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.3.22" osisID="Mark.3.22" n="22" />The teachers of the Law, who had come down from Jerusalem, said, “He has Beelzebul in him! He drives the demons out by the help of their chief.”
<verse eID="Mark.3.22" />
<verse sID="Mark.3.23" osisID="Mark.3.23" n="23" />So Jesus called them to him, and answered them in parables, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“How can Satan drive out Satan?</q>
<verse eID="Mark.3.23" />
<verse sID="Mark.3.24" osisID="Mark.3.24" n="24" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">When a kingdom is divided against itself, it cannot last;</q>
<verse eID="Mark.3.24" />

<verse eID="Mark.3.25" />
<verse sID="Mark.3.26" osisID="Mark.3.26" n="26" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">So, if Satan is in revolt against himself and is divided, he cannot last – his end has come!</q>
<verse eID="Mark.3.26" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.3.27" osisID="Mark.3.27" n="27" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“No man who has broken into a strong man’s house can carry off his goods, without first tying him up; and not until then will he plunder his house.</q>
<verse eID="Mark.3.27" />
<verse sID="Mark.3.28" osisID="Mark.3.28" n="28" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">I tell you that people will be forgiven everything – their sins, and all the slanders that they utter;</q>
<verse eID="Mark.3.28" />
<verse sID="Mark.3.29" osisID="Mark.3.29" n="29" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">but whoever slanders the Holy Spirit remains unforgiven to the end; he has to answer for an enduring sin.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.3.29" />
<verse sID="Mark.3.30" osisID="Mark.3.30" n="30" />This was said in reply to the charge that he had a foul spirit in him.
<verse eID="Mark.3.30" />
<verse sID="Mark.3.31" osisID="Mark.3.31" n="31" />His mother and his brothers came, and stood outside, and sent to ask him to come to them.
<verse eID="Mark.3.31" />
<verse sID="Mark.3.32" osisID="Mark.3.32" n="32" />There was a crowd sitting around Jesus, and some of them said to him, “Look, your mother and your brothers are outside, asking for you.”
<verse eID="Mark.3.32" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.3.33" osisID="Mark.3.33" n="33" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Who is my mother? And my brothers?”</q>  was his reply.
<verse eID="Mark.3.33" />
<verse sID="Mark.3.34" osisID="Mark.3.34" n="34" />Then he looked around on the people sitting in a circle around him, and said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Here are my mother and my brothers!</q>
<verse eID="Mark.3.34" />
<verse sID="Mark.3.35" osisID="Mark.3.35" n="35" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">Whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.3.35" />
<chapter eID="Mark.3" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Mark.4" osisID="Mark.4" n="4" />
<verse sID="Mark.4.1" osisID="Mark.4.1" n="1" />Jesus again began to teach by the sea; and, as an immense crowd was gathering around him, he got into a boat, and sat in it on the sea, while all the people were on the shore at the water’s edge.
<verse eID="Mark.4.1" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.4.2" osisID="Mark.4.2" n="2" />Then he taught them many truths in parables; and in the course of his teaching he said to them:
<verse eID="Mark.4.2" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.4.3" osisID="Mark.4.3" n="3" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Listen! The sower went out to sow;</q>
<verse eID="Mark.4.3" />
<verse sID="Mark.4.4" osisID="Mark.4.4" n="4" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">and presently, as he was sowing, some of the seed fell along the path; and the birds came, and ate it up.</q>
<verse eID="Mark.4.4" />
<verse sID="Mark.4.5" osisID="Mark.4.5" n="5" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">Some fell on rocky ground, where it had not much soil, and, because the soil wasn’t deep, sprang up at once;</q>
<verse eID="Mark.4.5" />
<verse sID="Mark.4.6" osisID="Mark.4.6" n="6" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">but, when the sun rose, it was scorched, and, because their roots were not deep enough, withered away.</q>
<verse eID="Mark.4.6" />
<verse sID="Mark.4.7" osisID="Mark.4.7" n="7" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">Some of the seed fell among brambles; but the brambles shot up and completely choked it, and it yielded no return.</q>
<verse eID="Mark.4.7" />
<verse sID="Mark.4.8" osisID="Mark.4.8" n="8" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">Some fell into good soil, and, shooting up and growing, yielded a return, amounting to thirty, sixty, and even a hundred fold.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.4.8" />
<verse sID="Mark.4.9" osisID="Mark.4.9" n="9" />And Jesus said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Let anyone who has ears to hear with hear.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.4.9" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.4.10" osisID="Mark.4.10" n="10" />Afterward, when he was alone, his followers and the Twelve asked him about his parables;
<verse eID="Mark.4.10" />
<verse sID="Mark.4.11" osisID="Mark.4.11" n="11" />and he said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“To you the hidden truth of the kingdom of God has been imparted; but to those who are outside it all teaching takes the form of parables so that –</q>

<verse sID="Mark.4.12" osisID="Mark.4.12" n="12" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">‘Though they have eyes, they may see without perceiving; and though they have ears, they may hear without understanding; otherwise some day they might turn and be forgiven.’”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.4.12" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.4.13" osisID="Mark.4.13" n="13" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“You do not know the meaning of this parable?”</q>  he went on, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Then how will you understand all the other parables?</q>
<verse eID="Mark.4.13" />
<verse sID="Mark.4.14" osisID="Mark.4.14" n="14" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">The sower sows the message.</q>

<verse sID="Mark.4.15" osisID="Mark.4.15" n="15" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">The people meant by the seed that falls along the path are these – where the message is sown, but, as soon as they have heard it, Satan immediately comes and carries away the message that has been sown in them.</q>
<verse eID="Mark.4.15" />
<verse sID="Mark.4.16" osisID="Mark.4.16" n="16" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">So, too, those meant by the seed sown on the rocky places are the people who, when they have heard the message, at once accept it joyfully;</q>
<verse eID="Mark.4.16" />
<verse sID="Mark.4.17" osisID="Mark.4.17" n="17" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">but, as they have no root, they stand only for a short time; and so, when trouble or persecution arises because of the message, they fall away at once.</q>

<verse sID="Mark.4.18" osisID="Mark.4.18" n="18" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">Those meant by the seed sown among the brambles are different; they are the people who hear the message,</q>
<verse eID="Mark.4.18" />
<verse sID="Mark.4.19" osisID="Mark.4.19" n="19" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">but the cares of life, and the glamour of wealth, and cravings for many other things come in and completely choke the message, so that it gives no return.</q>
<verse eID="Mark.4.19" />
<verse sID="Mark.4.20" osisID="Mark.4.20" n="20" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">But the people meant by the seed sown on the good ground are those who hear the message, and welcome it, and yield a return, thirty, sixty, and even a hundred fold.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.4.20" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.4.21" osisID="Mark.4.21" n="21" />Jesus said to them, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Is a lamp brought to be put under a basket or under the couch, instead of being put on the lamp-stand?</q>

<verse eID="Mark.4.25" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.4.26" osisID="Mark.4.26" n="26" />Jesus also said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“This is what the kingdom of God is like – like a man who has scattered seed on the ground,</q>
<verse eID="Mark.4.26" />
<verse sID="Mark.4.27" osisID="Mark.4.27" n="27" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">and then sleeps by night and rises by day, while the seed is shooting up and growing – he knows not how.</q>
<verse eID="Mark.4.27" />
<verse sID="Mark.4.28" osisID="Mark.4.28" n="28" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">The ground bears the crop of itself – first the blade, then the ear, and then the full grain in the ear;</q>
<verse eID="Mark.4.28" />
<verse sID="Mark.4.29" osisID="Mark.4.29" n="29" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">but, as soon as the crop is ready, immediately he puts in the sickle because harvest has come.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.4.29" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.4.30" osisID="Mark.4.30" n="30" />Jesus also said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“To what can we liken the kingdom of God?</q>
<verse eID="Mark.4.30" />
<verse sID="Mark.4.31" osisID="Mark.4.31" n="31" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">By what can we illustrate it? Perhaps by the growth of a mustard seed. This seed, when sown in the ground, though it is smaller than all other seeds,</q>
<verse eID="Mark.4.31" />
<verse sID="Mark.4.32" osisID="Mark.4.32" n="32" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">yet, when sown, shoots up, and becomes larger than any other herb, and puts out great branches, so that even the wild birds can roost in its shelter.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.4.32" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.4.33" osisID="Mark.4.33" n="33" />With many such parables Jesus used to speak to the people of his message, as far as they were able to receive it;
<verse eID="Mark.4.33" />
<verse sID="Mark.4.34" osisID="Mark.4.34" n="34" />and to them he never used to speak except in parables; but in private to his own disciples he explained everything.
<verse eID="Mark.4.34" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.4.35" osisID="Mark.4.35" n="35" />In the evening of the same day, Jesus said to them, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Let us go across.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.4.35" />
<verse sID="Mark.4.36" osisID="Mark.4.36" n="36" />So, leaving the crowd behind, they took him with them, just as he was, in the boat; and there were other boats with him.
<verse eID="Mark.4.36" />
<verse sID="Mark.4.37" osisID="Mark.4.37" n="37" />A violent squall came on, and the waves kept dashing into the boat, so that the boat was actually filling.
<verse eID="Mark.4.37" />
<verse sID="Mark.4.38" osisID="Mark.4.38" n="38" />Jesus was in the stern asleep on the cushion; and the disciples roused him and cried, “Teacher! Is it nothing to you that we are lost?”
<verse eID="Mark.4.38" />
<verse sID="Mark.4.39" osisID="Mark.4.39" n="39" />Jesus rose and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Hush! Be still!”</q>  Then the wind dropped, and a great calm followed.
<verse eID="Mark.4.39" />
<verse sID="Mark.4.40" osisID="Mark.4.40" n="40" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Why are you so timid?”</q>  he exclaimed. <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Have you no faith yet?”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.4.40" />
<verse sID="Mark.4.41" osisID="Mark.4.41" n="41" />But they were struck with great awe, and said to one another, “Who can this be that even the wind and the sea obey him?”
<verse eID="Mark.4.41" />
<chapter eID="Mark.4" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Mark.5" osisID="Mark.5" n="5" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.1" osisID="Mark.5.1" n="1" />They came to the other side of the sea – the region of the Gerasenes;
<verse eID="Mark.5.1" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.2" osisID="Mark.5.2" n="2" />and, as soon as Jesus had got out of the boat, he met a man coming out of the tombs, who was under the power of a foul spirit,
<verse eID="Mark.5.2" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.3" osisID="Mark.5.3" n="3" />and who made his home in the tombs. No one had ever been able to secure him, even with a chain;
<verse eID="Mark.5.3" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.4" osisID="Mark.5.4" n="4" />for, though he had many times been left secured with fetters and chains, he had snapped the chains and broken the fetters to pieces, and no one could master him.
<verse eID="Mark.5.4" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.5" osisID="Mark.5.5" n="5" />Night and day alike, he was continually shrieking in the tombs and among the hills, and cutting himself with stones.
<verse eID="Mark.5.5" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.6" osisID="Mark.5.6" n="6" />Catching sight of Jesus from a distance, he ran and bowed to the ground before him,
<verse eID="Mark.5.6" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.7" osisID="Mark.5.7" n="7" />shrieking out in a loud voice, “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? For God’s sake do not torment me!”
<verse eID="Mark.5.7" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.8" osisID="Mark.5.8" n="8" />For Jesus had said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Come out from the man, you foul spirit.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.5.8" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.9" osisID="Mark.5.9" n="9" />And he asked him, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“What is your name?”</q>  “My name,” he said, “is Legion, for there are many of us;”
<verse eID="Mark.5.9" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.10" osisID="Mark.5.10" n="10" />and he begged Jesus again and again not to send them away out of that country.
<verse eID="Mark.5.10" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.5.11" osisID="Mark.5.11" n="11" />There was a large drove of pigs close by, feeding on the hillside;
<verse eID="Mark.5.11" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.12" osisID="Mark.5.12" n="12" />and the spirits begged Jesus, “Send us into the pigs so that we can take possession of them.”
<verse eID="Mark.5.12" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.13" osisID="Mark.5.13" n="13" />Jesus gave them leave. They came out, and entered into the pigs; and the drove – about two thousand in number – rushed down the steep slope into the sea and were drowned in the sea.
<verse eID="Mark.5.13" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.5.14" osisID="Mark.5.14" n="14" />Then the men who tended them ran away, and carried the news to the town, and to the country around; and the people went to see what had happened.
<verse eID="Mark.5.14" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.15" osisID="Mark.5.15" n="15" />When they came to Jesus, they found the possessed man sitting there, clothed and in his right mind – the man who had had the ‘Legion’ in him – and they were awe-struck.
<verse eID="Mark.5.15" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.16" osisID="Mark.5.16" n="16" />Then those who had seen it related to them all that had happened to the possessed man, as well as about the pigs;
<verse eID="Mark.5.16" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.17" osisID="Mark.5.17" n="17" />so they began to beg Jesus to leave their region.
<verse eID="Mark.5.17" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.5.18" osisID="Mark.5.18" n="18" />As Jesus was getting into the boat, the possessed man begged him to let him stay with him.
<verse eID="Mark.5.18" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.19" osisID="Mark.5.19" n="19" />But Jesus refused. <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Go back to your home, to your own people,”</q>  he said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“and tell them of all that the Lord has done for you, and how he took pity on you.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.5.19" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.20" osisID="Mark.5.20" n="20" />So the man went, and began to proclaim in the district of the Ten Towns all that Jesus had done for him; and everyone was amazed.
<verse eID="Mark.5.20" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.5.21" osisID="Mark.5.21" n="21" />By the time Jesus had recrossed in the boat to the opposite shore, a great number of people had gathered to meet him, and were standing by the sea.
<verse eID="Mark.5.21" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.22" osisID="Mark.5.22" n="22" />One of the leaders of the synagogue, whose name was Jairus, came and, as soon as he saw Jesus, threw himself at his feet and begged him repeatedly,
<verse eID="Mark.5.22" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.23" osisID="Mark.5.23" n="23" />saying, “My little daughter is at death’s door. Please come and place your hands on her so that she may recover and live.”
<verse eID="Mark.5.23" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.24" osisID="Mark.5.24" n="24" />So Jesus went with him. A great number of people followed Jesus, and kept pressing around him.
<verse eID="Mark.5.24" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.5.25" osisID="Mark.5.25" n="25" />Meanwhile a woman who for twelve years had suffered from hemorrhage,
<verse eID="Mark.5.25" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.26" osisID="Mark.5.26" n="26" />and undergone much at the hands of many doctors, (spending all she had without obtaining any relief, but, on the contrary, growing worse),
<verse eID="Mark.5.26" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.27" osisID="Mark.5.27" n="27" />heard about Jesus, came behind in the crowd, and touched his cloak.
<verse eID="Mark.5.27" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.28" osisID="Mark.5.28" n="28" />“If I can only touch his clothes,” she said, “I will get well!”
<verse eID="Mark.5.28" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.29" osisID="Mark.5.29" n="29" />At once her bleeding stopped, and she felt in herself that she was cured of her affliction.
<verse eID="Mark.5.29" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.30" osisID="Mark.5.30" n="30" />Jesus at once became aware of the power that had gone out from him, and, turning around in the crowd, he said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Who touched my clothes?”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.5.30" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.5.31" osisID="Mark.5.31" n="31" />“You see the people pressing around you,” exclaimed his disciples, “and yet you say <q who="Jesus" marker="">‘Who touched me?’”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.5.31" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.32" osisID="Mark.5.32" n="32" />But Jesus looked about to see who had done it.
<verse eID="Mark.5.32" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.33" osisID="Mark.5.33" n="33" />Then the woman, in fear and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and threw herself down before him, and told him the whole truth.
<verse eID="Mark.5.33" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.34" osisID="Mark.5.34" n="34" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Daughter,”</q>  he said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“your faith has delivered you. Go, and peace be with you; be free from your affliction.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.5.34" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.5.35" osisID="Mark.5.35" n="35" />Before he had finished speaking, some people from the house of the synagogue leader came and said, “Your daughter is dead! Why should you trouble the teacher further?”
<verse eID="Mark.5.35" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.36" osisID="Mark.5.36" n="36" />But Jesus, overhearing what they were saying, said to the synagogue leader, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Do not be afraid; only have faith.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.5.36" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.37" osisID="Mark.5.37" n="37" />And he allowed no one to accompany him, except Peter, James, and John, the brother of James.
<verse eID="Mark.5.37" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.38" osisID="Mark.5.38" n="38" />Presently they reached the leader’s house, where Jesus saw a scene of confusion – people weeping and wailing incessantly.
<verse eID="Mark.5.38" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.39" osisID="Mark.5.39" n="39" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Why this confusion and weeping?”</q>  he said on entering. <q who="Jesus" marker="">“The little child is not dead; she is asleep.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.5.39" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.40" osisID="Mark.5.40" n="40" />They began to laugh at him; but he sent them all out, and then, with the child’s father and mother and his companions, went into the room where she was lying.
<verse eID="Mark.5.40" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.41" osisID="Mark.5.41" n="41" />Taking her hand, Jesus said to her, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Talitha, koum!”</q>  – which means <q who="Jesus" marker="">‘little girl, I am speaking to you – Rise!’</q>
<verse eID="Mark.5.41" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.42" osisID="Mark.5.42" n="42" />The little girl stood up at once, and began to walk about; for she was twelve years old. And, as soon as they saw it, they were overwhelmed with amazement;
<verse eID="Mark.5.42" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.43" osisID="Mark.5.43" n="43" />but Jesus repeatedly cautioned them not to let anyone know of it, and told them to give her something to eat.
<verse eID="Mark.5.43" />

</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Mark.6" osisID="Mark.6" n="6" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.1" osisID="Mark.6.1" n="1" />On leaving that place, Jesus, followed by his disciples, went to his own part of the country.
<verse eID="Mark.6.1" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.2" osisID="Mark.6.2" n="2" />When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue; and the people, as they listened, were deeply impressed. “Where did he get this?” they said, “and what is this wisdom that has been given him? And these miracles which he is doing?
<verse eID="Mark.6.2" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.3" osisID="Mark.6.3" n="3" />Isn’t he the carpenter, the son of Mary, and the brother of James, and Joses, and Judas, and Simon? And aren’t his sisters, too, living here among us?” This proved a hindrance to their believing in him;
<verse eID="Mark.6.3" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.4" osisID="Mark.6.4" n="4" />at which Jesus said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“A prophet is not without honor, except in his home town, and among his own relatives, and in his own home.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.6.4" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.5" osisID="Mark.6.5" n="5" />And he could not work any miracle there, beyond placing his hands on a few infirm persons, and curing them;
<verse eID="Mark.6.5" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.6" osisID="Mark.6.6" n="6" />and he wondered at the want of faith shown by the people. Jesus went around the villages, one after another, teaching.
<verse eID="Mark.6.6" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.6.7" osisID="Mark.6.7" n="7" />He called the Twelve to him, and began to send them out as his messengers, two and two, and gave them authority over foul spirits.
<verse eID="Mark.6.7" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.8" osisID="Mark.6.8" n="8" />He instructed them to take nothing but a staff for the journey – not even bread, or a bag, or coins in their purse;
<verse eID="Mark.6.8" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.9" osisID="Mark.6.9" n="9" />but they were to wear sandals, and not to put on a second coat.
<verse eID="Mark.6.9" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.10" osisID="Mark.6.10" n="10" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Whenever you go to stay at a house,”</q>  he said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“remain there until you leave that place;</q>
<verse eID="Mark.6.10" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.11" osisID="Mark.6.11" n="11" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">and if a place does not welcome you, or listen to you, as you go out of it shake off the dust that is on the soles of your feet, as a protest against them.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.6.11" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.12" osisID="Mark.6.12" n="12" />So they set out, and proclaimed the need of repentance.
<verse eID="Mark.6.12" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.13" osisID="Mark.6.13" n="13" />They drove out many demons, and anointed with oil many who were infirm, and cured them.
<verse eID="Mark.6.13" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.6.14" osisID="Mark.6.14" n="14" />Now King Herod heard of Jesus; for his name had become well known. People were saying – “John the Baptizer must have risen from the dead, and that is why these miraculous powers are active in him.”
<verse eID="Mark.6.14" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.15" osisID="Mark.6.15" n="15" />Others again said – “He is Elijah,” and others – “He is a prophet, like one of the great prophets.”
<verse eID="Mark.6.15" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.16" osisID="Mark.6.16" n="16" />But when Herod heard of him, he said – “The man whom I beheaded – John – he must be risen!”
<verse eID="Mark.6.16" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.6.17" osisID="Mark.6.17" n="17" />For Herod himself had sent and arrested John, and put him in prison, in chains, to please Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip, because Herod had married her.
<verse eID="Mark.6.17" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.18" osisID="Mark.6.18" n="18" />For John had said to Herod – “You have no right to be living with your brother’s wife.”
<verse eID="Mark.6.18" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.19" osisID="Mark.6.19" n="19" />So Herodias was incensed against John, and wanted to put him to death, but was unable to do so,
<verse eID="Mark.6.19" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.20" osisID="Mark.6.20" n="20" />because Herod stood in fear of John, knowing him to be an upright and holy man, and protected him. He had listened to John, but still remained much perplexed, and yet he found pleasure in listening to him.
<verse eID="Mark.6.20" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.6.21" osisID="Mark.6.21" n="21" />A suitable opportunity, however, occurred when Herod, on his birthday, gave a dinner to his high officials, and his generals, and the foremost men in Galilee.
<verse eID="Mark.6.21" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.22" osisID="Mark.6.22" n="22" />When his daughter – that is, the daughter of Herodias – came in and danced, she delighted Herod and those who were dining with him. “Ask me for whatever you like,” the king said to the girl, “and I will give it to you”;
<verse eID="Mark.6.22" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.23" osisID="Mark.6.23" n="23" />and he swore to her that he would give her whatever she asked him – up to half his kingdom.
<verse eID="Mark.6.23" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.24" osisID="Mark.6.24" n="24" />The girl went out, and said to her mother “What must I ask for?”
</p>
<p>
“The head of John the Baptizer,” answered her mother.
<verse eID="Mark.6.24" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.25" osisID="Mark.6.25" n="25" />So she went in as quickly as possible to the king, and made her request. “I want you,” she said, “to give me at once, on a dish, the head of John the Baptist.”
<verse eID="Mark.6.25" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.26" osisID="Mark.6.26" n="26" />The king was much distressed; yet, because of his oath and of the guests at his table, he did not like to refuse her.
<verse eID="Mark.6.26" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.27" osisID="Mark.6.27" n="27" />He immediately dispatched one of his bodyguard, with orders to bring John’s head. The man went and beheaded John in the prison,
<verse eID="Mark.6.27" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.28" osisID="Mark.6.28" n="28" />and, bringing his head on a dish, gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother.
<verse eID="Mark.6.28" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.6.29" osisID="Mark.6.29" n="29" />When John’s disciples heard of it, they came and took his body away, and laid it in a tomb.
<verse eID="Mark.6.29" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.6.30" osisID="Mark.6.30" n="30" />When the apostles came back to Jesus, they told him all that they had done and all that they had taught.
<verse eID="Mark.6.30" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.31" osisID="Mark.6.31" n="31" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Come by yourselves privately to some lonely spot,”</q>  he said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“and rest for a while”</q>  – for there were so many people coming and going that they had not time even to eat.
<verse eID="Mark.6.31" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.32" osisID="Mark.6.32" n="32" />So they set off privately in their boat for a lonely spot.
<verse eID="Mark.6.32" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.33" osisID="Mark.6.33" n="33" />Many people saw them going, and recognized them, and from all the towns they flocked together to the place on foot, and got there before them.
<verse eID="Mark.6.33" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.34" osisID="Mark.6.34" n="34" />On getting out of the boat, Jesus saw a great crowd, and his heart was moved at the sight of them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd; and he began to teach them many things.
<verse eID="Mark.6.34" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.35" osisID="Mark.6.35" n="35" />When it grew late, his disciples came up to him, and said, “This is a lonely spot, and it is already late.
<verse eID="Mark.6.35" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.36" osisID="Mark.6.36" n="36" />Send the people away, so that they may go to the farms and villages around and buy themselves something to eat.”
<verse eID="Mark.6.36" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.37" osisID="Mark.6.37" n="37" />But Jesus answered, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“It is for you to give them something to eat.”</q>  “Are we to go and spend almost a year’s wages on bread,” they asked, “to give them to eat?”
<verse eID="Mark.6.37" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.6.38" osisID="Mark.6.38" n="38" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“How many loaves have you?”</q>  he asked, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Go, and see.”</q>  When they had found out, they told him, “Five, and two fish.”
<verse eID="Mark.6.38" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.39" osisID="Mark.6.39" n="39" />Jesus directed them to make all the people take their seats on the green grass, in parties;
<verse eID="Mark.6.39" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.40" osisID="Mark.6.40" n="40" />and they sat down in groups – in hundreds, and in fifties.
<verse eID="Mark.6.40" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.41" osisID="Mark.6.41" n="41" />Taking the five loaves and the two fish, Jesus looked up to heaven, and said the blessing; he broke the loaves into pieces, and gave them to his disciples for them to serve out to the people, and he divided the two fish also among them all.
<verse eID="Mark.6.41" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.42" osisID="Mark.6.42" n="42" />Everyone had sufficient to eat;
<verse eID="Mark.6.42" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.43" osisID="Mark.6.43" n="43" />and they picked up enough broken pieces to fill twelve baskets, as well as some of the fish.
<verse eID="Mark.6.43" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.44" osisID="Mark.6.44" n="44" />The people who ate the bread were five thousand in number.
<verse eID="Mark.6.44" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.6.45" osisID="Mark.6.45" n="45" />Immediately afterward Jesus made his disciples get into the boat, and cross over in advance, in the direction of Bethsaida, while he himself was dismissing the crowd.
<verse eID="Mark.6.45" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.46" osisID="Mark.6.46" n="46" />After he had taken leave of the people, he went away up the hill to pray.
<verse eID="Mark.6.46" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.47" osisID="Mark.6.47" n="47" />When evening fell, the boat was out in the middle of the sea, and Jesus on the shore alone.
<verse eID="Mark.6.47" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.48" osisID="Mark.6.48" n="48" />Seeing them laboring at the oars – for the wind was against them – about three hours after midnight Jesus came towards them, walking on the water, intending to join them.
<verse eID="Mark.6.48" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.49" osisID="Mark.6.49" n="49" />But, when they saw him walking on the water, they thought it was a ghost, and cried out;
<verse eID="Mark.6.49" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.50" osisID="Mark.6.50" n="50" />for all of them saw him, and were terrified. But Jesus at once spoke to them. <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Courage!”</q>  he said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“it is I; do not be afraid!”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.6.50" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.51" osisID="Mark.6.51" n="51" />Then he got into the boat with them, and the wind dropped. The disciples were utterly amazed,
<verse eID="Mark.6.51" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.52" osisID="Mark.6.52" n="52" />for they had not understood about the loaves, their minds being slow to learn.
<verse eID="Mark.6.52" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.53" osisID="Mark.6.53" n="53" />When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret, and moored the boat.
<verse eID="Mark.6.53" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.54" osisID="Mark.6.54" n="54" />But they had no sooner left her than the people, recognizing Jesus,
<verse eID="Mark.6.54" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.55" osisID="Mark.6.55" n="55" />hurried over the whole country-side, and began to carry about on mats those who were ill, wherever they heard he was.
<verse eID="Mark.6.55" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.56" osisID="Mark.6.56" n="56" />So wherever he went – to villages, or towns, or farms – they would lay their sick in the market-places, begging him to let them touch only the tassel of his cloak; and all who touched were made well.
<verse eID="Mark.6.56" />

<p>
<chapter sID="Mark.7" osisID="Mark.7" n="7" />
<verse sID="Mark.7.1" osisID="Mark.7.1" n="1" />One day the Pharisees and some of the teachers of the Law who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus.
<verse eID="Mark.7.1" />
<verse sID="Mark.7.2" osisID="Mark.7.2" n="2" />They had noticed that some of his disciples ate their food with their hands ‘defiled,’ by which they meant unwashed.
<verse eID="Mark.7.2" />
<verse sID="Mark.7.3" osisID="Mark.7.3" n="3" />(For the Pharisees, and indeed all strict Jews, will not eat without first scrupulously washing their hands, holding in this to the traditions of their ancestors.
<verse eID="Mark.7.3" />
<verse sID="Mark.7.4" osisID="Mark.7.4" n="4" />When they come from market, they will not eat without first sprinkling themselves; and there are many other customs which they have inherited and hold to, such as the ceremonial washing of cups, and jugs, and copper pans).
<verse eID="Mark.7.4" />
<verse sID="Mark.7.5" osisID="Mark.7.5" n="5" />So the Pharisees and the teachers of the Law asked Jesus this question – “How is it that your disciples do not follow the traditions of our ancestors, but eat their food with defiled hands?”
<verse eID="Mark.7.5" />
<verse sID="Mark.7.6" osisID="Mark.7.6" n="6" />His answer was, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“It was well said by Isaiah when he prophesied about you hypocrites in the words – ‘This is a people who honor me with their lips, while their hearts are far removed from me;</q>

<verse eID="Mark.7.13" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.7.14" osisID="Mark.7.14" n="14" />Then Jesus called the people to him again, and said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Listen to me, all of you, and mark my words.</q>

<verse sID="Mark.7.24" osisID="Mark.7.24" n="24" />On leaving that place, Jesus went to the district of Tyre and Sidon. He went into a house, and did not wish anyone to know it, but could not escape notice.
<verse eID="Mark.7.24" />
<verse sID="Mark.7.25" osisID="Mark.7.25" n="25" />For a woman, whose little daughter had a foul spirit in her, heard of him immediately, and came and threw herself at his feet –

<verse sID="Mark.7.35" osisID="Mark.7.35" n="35" />The man’s ears were opened, the string of his tongue was freed, and he began to talk plainly.
<verse eID="Mark.7.35" />
<verse sID="Mark.7.36" osisID="Mark.7.36" n="36" />Jesus insisted on their not telling anyone; but the more he insisted, the more perseveringly they made it known,
<verse eID="Mark.7.36" />
<verse sID="Mark.7.37" osisID="Mark.7.37" n="37" />and a profound impression was made on the people. “He has done everything well!” they exclaimed. “He makes even the deaf hear and the dumb speak!”

<p>
<chapter sID="Mark.8" osisID="Mark.8" n="8" />
<verse sID="Mark.8.1" osisID="Mark.8.1" n="1" />About that time, when there was again a great crowd of people who had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to him, and said,
<verse eID="Mark.8.1" />
<verse sID="Mark.8.2" osisID="Mark.8.2" n="2" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“My heart is moved at the sight of all these people, for they have already been with me three days and they have nothing to eat;</q>
<verse eID="Mark.8.2" />
<verse sID="Mark.8.3" osisID="Mark.8.3" n="3" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">and if I send them away to their homes hungry, they will break down on the way; and some of them have come a long distance.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.8.3" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.8.4" osisID="Mark.8.4" n="4" />“Where will it be possible,” his disciples answered, “to get sufficient bread for these people in this lonely place?”
<verse eID="Mark.8.4" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.8.5" osisID="Mark.8.5" n="5" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“How many loaves have you?”</q>  he asked. “Seven,” they answered.
<verse eID="Mark.8.5" />
<verse sID="Mark.8.6" osisID="Mark.8.6" n="6" />Jesus told the crowd to sit down on the ground. Then he took the seven loaves, and, after saying the thanksgiving, broke them, and gave them to his disciples to serve out; and they served them out to the crowd.
<verse eID="Mark.8.6" />
<verse sID="Mark.8.7" osisID="Mark.8.7" n="7" />They had also a few small fish; and, after he had said the blessing, he told the disciples to serve out these as well.
<verse eID="Mark.8.7" />
<verse sID="Mark.8.8" osisID="Mark.8.8" n="8" />The people had sufficient to eat, and they picked up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left.
<verse eID="Mark.8.8" />
<verse sID="Mark.8.9" osisID="Mark.8.9" n="9" />There were about four thousand people. Then Jesus dismissed them.
<verse eID="Mark.8.9" />
<verse sID="Mark.8.10" osisID="Mark.8.10" n="10" />Immediately afterward, getting into the boat with his disciples, Jesus went to the district of Dalmanutha.
<verse eID="Mark.8.10" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.8.11" osisID="Mark.8.11" n="11" />Here the Pharisees came out, and began to argue with Jesus, asking him for some sign from the heavens, to test him.
<verse eID="Mark.8.11" />
<verse sID="Mark.8.12" osisID="Mark.8.12" n="12" />Sighing deeply, Jesus said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Why does this generation ask for a sign? I tell you, no sign will be given it.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.8.12" />
<verse sID="Mark.8.13" osisID="Mark.8.13" n="13" />So he left them to themselves, and, getting into the boat again, went away to the opposite shore.
<verse eID="Mark.8.13" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.8.14" osisID="Mark.8.14" n="14" />Now the disciples had forgotten to take any bread with them, one loaf being all that they had in the boat.
<verse eID="Mark.8.14" />
<verse sID="Mark.8.15" osisID="Mark.8.15" n="15" />So Jesus gave them this warning. <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Take care,”</q>  he said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.8.15" />
<verse sID="Mark.8.16" osisID="Mark.8.16" n="16" />They began talking to one another about their being short of bread;
<verse eID="Mark.8.16" />
<verse sID="Mark.8.17" osisID="Mark.8.17" n="17" />and, noticing this, Jesus said to them, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Why are you talking about your being short of bread? Don’t you yet see or understand? Are your minds still so slow or comprehension?</q>
<verse eID="Mark.8.17" />
<verse sID="Mark.8.18" osisID="Mark.8.18" n="18" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">Though you have eyes, do you not see? And though you have ears, do you not hear? Don’t you remember,</q>

<verse sID="Mark.8.19" osisID="Mark.8.19" n="19" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">when I broke up the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets of broken pieces you picked up?”</q>
</p>
<p>
“Twelve,” they said.
<verse eID="Mark.8.19" />
<verse sID="Mark.8.20" osisID="Mark.8.20" n="20" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“And when the seven for the four thousand, how many basketfuls of broken pieces did you pick up?”</q>
</p>
<p>
“Seven,” they said.
<verse eID="Mark.8.20" />
<verse sID="Mark.8.21" osisID="Mark.8.21" n="21" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Don’t you understand now?”</q>  he repeated.
<verse eID="Mark.8.21" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.8.22" osisID="Mark.8.22" n="22" />They came to Bethsaida. There some people brought a blind man to Jesus, and begged him to touch him.
<verse eID="Mark.8.22" />
<verse sID="Mark.8.23" osisID="Mark.8.23" n="23" />Taking the blind man’s hand, Jesus led him to the outskirts of the village, and, when he had put saliva on the man’s eyes, he placed his hands on him, and asked him, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Do you see anything?”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.8.23" />
<verse sID="Mark.8.24" osisID="Mark.8.24" n="24" />The man looked up, and said, “I see the people, for, as they walk about, they look to me like trees.”
<verse eID="Mark.8.24" />
<verse sID="Mark.8.25" osisID="Mark.8.25" n="25" />Then Jesus again placed his hands on the man’s eyes; and the man saw clearly, his sight was restored, and he saw everything with perfect distinctness.
<verse eID="Mark.8.25" />
<verse sID="Mark.8.26" osisID="Mark.8.26" n="26" />Jesus sent him to his home, and said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Do not go even into the village.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.8.26" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.8.27" osisID="Mark.8.27" n="27" />Afterward Jesus and his disciples went into the villages around Caesarea Philippi; and on the way he asked his disciples this question – <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Who do people say that I am?”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.8.27" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.8.28" osisID="Mark.8.28" n="28" />“John the Baptist,” they answered, “but others say Elijah, while others say one of the prophets.”
<verse eID="Mark.8.28" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.8.29" osisID="Mark.8.29" n="29" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“But you,”</q>  he asked, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“who do you say that I am?”</q>  To this Peter replied, “You are the Christ.”
<verse eID="Mark.8.29" />
<verse sID="Mark.8.30" osisID="Mark.8.30" n="30" />At which Jesus charged them not to say this about him to anyone.
<verse eID="Mark.8.30" />
<verse sID="Mark.8.31" osisID="Mark.8.31" n="31" />Then he began to teach them that the Son of Man must undergo much suffering, and that he must be rejected by the elders, and the chief priests, and the teachers of the Law, and be put to death, and rise again after three days.
<verse eID="Mark.8.31" />
<verse sID="Mark.8.32" osisID="Mark.8.32" n="32" />He said all this quite openly. But Peter took Jesus aside, and began to rebuke him.
<verse eID="Mark.8.32" />
<verse sID="Mark.8.33" osisID="Mark.8.33" n="33" />Jesus, however, turning around and seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter. <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Out of my sight, Satan!”</q>  he exclaimed. <q who="Jesus" marker="">“For you look at things, not as God does, but as people do.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.8.33" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.8.34" osisID="Mark.8.34" n="34" />Calling the people and his disciples to him, Jesus said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“If anyone wishes to walk in my steps, they must renounce self, take up their cross, and follow me.</q>
<verse eID="Mark.8.34" />
<verse sID="Mark.8.35" osisID="Mark.8.35" n="35" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">For whoever wishes to save their life will lose it, and whoever, for my sake and for the sake of the good news, will lose their life will save it.</q>

<verse eID="Mark.9.1" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.9.2" osisID="Mark.9.2" n="2" />Six days later, Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John, and led them up a high mountain alone by themselves. There his appearance was transformed before their eyes,
<verse eID="Mark.9.2" />
<verse sID="Mark.9.3" osisID="Mark.9.3" n="3" />and his clothes became whiter than any launderer in the whole world could bleach them.
<verse eID="Mark.9.3" />
<verse sID="Mark.9.4" osisID="Mark.9.4" n="4" />And Elijah appeared to them, in company with Moses; and they were talking with Jesus.
<verse eID="Mark.9.4" />
<verse sID="Mark.9.5" osisID="Mark.9.5" n="5" />“Rabbi,” said Peter, interposing, “it is good to be here; let us make three tents, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”
<verse eID="Mark.9.5" />
<verse sID="Mark.9.6" osisID="Mark.9.6" n="6" />For he did not know what to say, because they were much afraid.
<verse eID="Mark.9.6" />
<verse sID="Mark.9.7" osisID="Mark.9.7" n="7" />Then a cloud came down and enveloped them; and from the cloud there came a voice – “This is my dearly loved son; listen to him.”
<verse eID="Mark.9.7" />
<verse sID="Mark.9.8" osisID="Mark.9.8" n="8" />And suddenly, on looking around, they saw that there was now no one with them but Jesus alone.
<verse eID="Mark.9.8" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.9.9" osisID="Mark.9.9" n="9" />As they were going down the mountainside, Jesus cautioned them not to relate what they had seen to anyone, until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead.
<verse eID="Mark.9.9" />
<verse sID="Mark.9.10" osisID="Mark.9.10" n="10" />They seized on these words and discussed with one another what this ‘rising from the dead’ meant.
<verse eID="Mark.9.10" />
<verse sID="Mark.9.11" osisID="Mark.9.11" n="11" />“How is it,” they asked Jesus, “that our teachers of the Law say that Elijah has to come first?”
<verse eID="Mark.9.11" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.9.12" osisID="Mark.9.12" n="12" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Elijah does indeed come first,”</q>  answered Jesus, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“and re-establish everything; and does not scripture speak, with regard to the Son of Man, of his undergoing much suffering and being utterly despised?</q>

<verse sID="Mark.9.13" osisID="Mark.9.13" n="13" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">But I tell you that Elijah has come, and people have treated him just as they pleased, as scripture says of him.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.9.13" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.9.14" osisID="Mark.9.14" n="14" />When they came to the other disciples, they saw a great crowd around them, and some teachers of the Law arguing with them.
<verse eID="Mark.9.14" />
<verse sID="Mark.9.15" osisID="Mark.9.15" n="15" />But, as soon as they saw Jesus, all the people, in great astonishment, ran up and greeted him.
<verse eID="Mark.9.15" />
<verse sID="Mark.9.16" osisID="Mark.9.16" n="16" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“What are you arguing about with them?”</q>  Jesus asked.
<verse eID="Mark.9.16" />
<verse sID="Mark.9.17" osisID="Mark.9.17" n="17" />“Teacher,” answered a man in the crowd, “I brought my son to see you, as he has a spirit in him that makes him mute;
<verse eID="Mark.9.17" />
<verse sID="Mark.9.18" osisID="Mark.9.18" n="18" />and, wherever it seizes him, it dashes him down; he foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth, and he is pining away. I asked your disciples to drive the spirit out, but they failed.”
<verse eID="Mark.9.18" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.9.19" osisID="Mark.9.19" n="19" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Faithless generation!”</q>  exclaimed Jesus. <q who="Jesus" marker="">“How long must I be with you? How long must I have patience with you? Bring the boy to me.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.9.19" />
<verse sID="Mark.9.20" osisID="Mark.9.20" n="20" />They brought him to Jesus; but no sooner did the boy see him than the spirit threw him into convulsions; and he fell on the ground, and rolled about, foaming at the mouth.
<verse eID="Mark.9.20" />
<verse sID="Mark.9.21" osisID="Mark.9.21" n="21" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“How long has he been like this?”</q>  Jesus asked the boy’s father.
<verse eID="Mark.9.21" />
<verse sID="Mark.9.22" osisID="Mark.9.22" n="22" />“From his childhood,” he answered. “It has often thrown him into fire and into water to put an end to his life; but, if you can possibly do anything, take pity on us, and help us!”
<verse eID="Mark.9.22" />
<verse sID="Mark.9.23" osisID="Mark.9.23" n="23" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Why say ‘possibly’?”</q>  Jesus replied. <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Everything is possible for one who has faith.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.9.23" />
<verse sID="Mark.9.24" osisID="Mark.9.24" n="24" />The boy’s father immediately cried out, “I have faith; help my want of faith!”
<verse eID="Mark.9.24" />
<verse sID="Mark.9.25" osisID="Mark.9.25" n="25" />But, when Jesus saw that a crowd was quickly collecting, he rebuked the foul spirit, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Deaf and dumb spirit, it is I who command you. Come out from him and never enter him again.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.9.25" />
<verse sID="Mark.9.26" osisID="Mark.9.26" n="26" />With a loud cry the spirit threw the boy into repeated convulsions, and then came out from him. The boy looked like a corpse, so that most of them said that he was dead.
<verse eID="Mark.9.26" />
<verse sID="Mark.9.27" osisID="Mark.9.27" n="27" />But Jesus took his hand, and lifted him; and he stood up.
<verse eID="Mark.9.27" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.9.28" osisID="Mark.9.28" n="28" />When Jesus had gone indoors, his disciples asked him privately, “Why couldn’t we drive it out?”

</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.9.29" osisID="Mark.9.29" n="29" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“A spirit of this kind,”</q>  he said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“can be driven out only by prayer.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.9.29" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.9.30" osisID="Mark.9.30" n="30" />Leaving that place, Jesus and his disciples went on their way through Galilee; but he did not wish anyone to know it,
<verse eID="Mark.9.30" />
<verse sID="Mark.9.31" osisID="Mark.9.31" n="31" />for he was instructing his disciples, and telling them – <q who="Jesus" marker="">“The Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of his fellow men, and they will put him to death, but, when he has been put to death, he will rise again after three days.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.9.31" />
<verse sID="Mark.9.32" osisID="Mark.9.32" n="32" />But the disciples did not understand his meaning and were afraid to question him.
<verse eID="Mark.9.32" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.9.33" osisID="Mark.9.33" n="33" />They came to Capernaum. When Jesus had gone into the house, he asked them, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“What were you discussing on the way?”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.9.33" />
<verse sID="Mark.9.34" osisID="Mark.9.34" n="34" />But they were silent; for on the way they had been arguing with one another which was the greatest.
<verse eID="Mark.9.34" />
<verse sID="Mark.9.35" osisID="Mark.9.35" n="35" />Sitting down, Jesus called the Twelve and said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“If anyone wishes to be first, he must be last of all, and servant of all.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.9.35" />
<verse sID="Mark.9.36" osisID="Mark.9.36" n="36" />Then Jesus took a little child, and placed it in the middle of them. Taking it in his arms, he said to them,

<p>
<verse sID="Mark.9.38" osisID="Mark.9.38" n="38" />“Teacher,” said John, “we saw a man driving out demons by using your name, and we tried to prevent him, because he did not follow us.”

<verse eID="Mark.11.6" />
<verse sID="Mark.11.7" osisID="Mark.11.7" n="7" />Then they brought the foal to Jesus, and, when they had laid their cloaks on it, he seated himself on it.
<verse eID="Mark.11.7" />
<verse sID="Mark.11.8" osisID="Mark.11.8" n="8" />Many of the people spread their cloaks on the road, while some strewed boughs which they had cut from the fields;

</p>
<p>

<verse sID="Mark.11.13" osisID="Mark.11.13" n="13" />and, noticing a fig-tree at a distance in leaf, he went to it to see if by any chance he could find something on it; but, on coming up to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs.
<verse eID="Mark.11.13" />
<verse sID="Mark.11.14" osisID="Mark.11.14" n="14" />So, addressing the tree, he exclaimed, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“May no one ever again eat of your fruit!”</q>  And his disciples heard what he said.

<p>

<verse eID="Mark.11.18" />
<verse sID="Mark.11.19" osisID="Mark.11.19" n="19" />As soon as evening fell, Jesus and his disciples went out of the city.

<verse eID="Mark.11.31" />
<verse sID="Mark.11.32" osisID="Mark.11.32" n="32" />Yet can we say ‘human’?” They were afraid of the people, for everyone regarded John as undoubtedly a prophet.

<verse sID="Mark.12.12" osisID="Mark.12.12" n="12" />After this his enemies were eager to arrest him, but they were afraid of the crowd; for they saw that it was at them that he had aimed the parable. So they left him alone, and went away.
<verse eID="Mark.12.12" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.12.13" osisID="Mark.12.13" n="13" />Afterward they sent to Jesus some of the Pharisees and Herodians, to set a trap for him in the course of conversation.
<verse eID="Mark.12.13" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.14" osisID="Mark.12.14" n="14" />These men came to him and said, “Teacher, we know that you are an honest man, and are not afraid of anyone, for you pay no regard to a person’s position, but teach the way of God honestly; are we right in paying taxes to the Emperor, or not?
<verse eID="Mark.12.14" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.15" osisID="Mark.12.15" n="15" />Should we pay, or should we not pay?” Knowing their hypocrisy, Jesus said to them, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Why are you testing me? Bring me a coin to look at.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.12.15" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.16" osisID="Mark.12.16" n="16" />And, when they had brought it, he asked, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Whose head and title are these?”</q>
</p>
<p>
“The Emperor’s,” they said;
<verse eID="Mark.12.16" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.17" osisID="Mark.12.17" n="17" />and Jesus replied, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Pay to the Emperor what belongs to the Emperor, and to God what belongs to God.”</q>  And they wondered at him.
<verse eID="Mark.12.17" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.12.18" osisID="Mark.12.18" n="18" />Next came some Sadducees – the men who maintain that there is no resurrection. Their question was this –
<verse eID="Mark.12.18" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.19" osisID="Mark.12.19" n="19" />“Teacher, in our scriptures Moses decreed that, should a man’s brother die, leaving a widow but no child, the man should take the widow as his wife, and raise up a family for his brother.
<verse eID="Mark.12.19" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.20" osisID="Mark.12.20" n="20" />There were once seven brothers. The eldest married, but died and left no family;
<verse eID="Mark.12.20" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.21" osisID="Mark.12.21" n="21" />and the second married his widow, and died without family; and so did the third.
<verse eID="Mark.12.21" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.22" osisID="Mark.12.22" n="22" />All the seven died and left no family. The woman herself died last of all.
<verse eID="Mark.12.22" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.23" osisID="Mark.12.23" n="23" />At the resurrection whose wife will she be, all seven brothers having had her as their wife?”
<verse eID="Mark.12.23" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.12.24" osisID="Mark.12.24" n="24" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Is not the reason of your mistake,”</q>  answered Jesus, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“your ignorance of the scriptures and of the power of God?</q>

<verse sID="Mark.12.27" osisID="Mark.12.27" n="27" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">He is not God of dead people, but of living. You are greatly mistaken.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.12.27" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.12.28" osisID="Mark.12.28" n="28" />Then came up one of the teachers of the Law who had heard their discussions. Knowing that Jesus had answered them wisely, he asked him this question, “Which commandment is the most important of all?”
<verse eID="Mark.12.28" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.12.29" osisID="Mark.12.29" n="29" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“The most important,”</q>  answered Jesus, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“is – ‘Hear, Israel; the Lord our God is the one Lord;</q>

<verse sID="Mark.12.30" osisID="Mark.12.30" n="30" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">and you must love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.’</q>
<verse eID="Mark.12.30" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.31" osisID="Mark.12.31" n="31" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">The second is this – ‘You must love your neighbor as you love yourself.’ There is no commandment greater than these.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.12.31" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.12.32" osisID="Mark.12.32" n="32" />“Wisely answered, teacher!” exclaimed the teacher of the Law. “It is true, as you say, that there is one God, and that there is no other besides him;
<verse eID="Mark.12.32" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.33" osisID="Mark.12.33" n="33" />and to love him with all one’s heart, and with all one’s understanding, and with all one’s strength, and to love one’s neighbor as one loves oneself is far beyond all burnt offerings and sacrifices.”
<verse eID="Mark.12.33" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.34" osisID="Mark.12.34" n="34" />Seeing that he had answered with discernment, Jesus said to him, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“You are not far from the kingdom of God.”</q>
</p>
<p>
After that no one ventured to question him further.
<verse eID="Mark.12.34" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.12.35" osisID="Mark.12.35" n="35" />While Jesus was teaching in the Temple Courts, he asked, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“How is it that the teachers of the Law say that the Christ is to be David’s son?</q>
<verse eID="Mark.12.35" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.36" osisID="Mark.12.36" n="36" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">David said himself, speaking under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit – ‘The Lord said to my lord: Sit at my right hand, until I put your enemies beneath your feet.’</q>

</p>
<p>
The mass of the people listened to Jesus with delight.
<verse eID="Mark.12.37" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.38" osisID="Mark.12.38" n="38" />In the course of his teaching, Jesus said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“See that you are on your guard against the teachers of the Law, who delight to walk about in long robes, and to be greeted in the streets with respect,</q>

<verse eID="Mark.12.40" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.12.41" osisID="Mark.12.41" n="41" />Then Jesus sat down opposite the chests for the Temple offerings, and watched how the people put money into them. Many rich people were putting in large sums;
<verse eID="Mark.12.41" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.42" osisID="Mark.12.42" n="42" />but one poor widow came and put in two small coins, worth very little.
<verse eID="Mark.12.42" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.43" osisID="Mark.12.43" n="43" />Then, calling his disciples to him, Jesus said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“I tell you that this poor widow has put in more than all the others who were putting money into the chests;</q>
<verse eID="Mark.12.43" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.44" osisID="Mark.12.44" n="44" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">for everyone else put in something from what he had to spare, while she, in her need, put in all she had – everything that she had to live on.”</q>

<p>

</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.13.3" osisID="Mark.13.3" n="3" />When Jesus had sat down on the Mount of Olives, facing the Temple, Peter, James, John and Andrew questioned him privately,

<verse sID="Mark.14.23" osisID="Mark.14.23" n="23" />Then he took a cup, and, after saying the thanksgiving, gave it to them, and they all drank from it.
<verse eID="Mark.14.23" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.24" osisID="Mark.14.24" n="24" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“This is my covenant-blood,”</q>  he said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“which is poured out on behalf of many.</q>
<verse eID="Mark.14.24" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.25" osisID="Mark.14.25" n="25" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">I tell you that I will never again drink of the juice of the grape, until that day when I will drink it new in the kingdom of God.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.14.25" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.14.26" osisID="Mark.14.26" n="26" />They then sang a hymn, and went out up the Mount of Olives,
<verse eID="Mark.14.26" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.27" osisID="Mark.14.27" n="27" />presently Jesus said to them, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“All of you will fall away; for scripture says – ‘I will strike down the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.’</q>
<verse eID="Mark.14.27" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.28" osisID="Mark.14.28" n="28" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">Yet, after I have risen, I will go before you into Galilee.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.14.28" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.14.29" osisID="Mark.14.29" n="29" />“Even if everyone else falls away,” said Peter, “I will not.”
<verse eID="Mark.14.29" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.14.30" osisID="Mark.14.30" n="30" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“I tell you,”</q>  answered Jesus, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“that you yourself today – yes, this very night – before the cock crows twice, will disown me three times.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.14.30" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.31" osisID="Mark.14.31" n="31" />But Peter vehemently protested, “Even if I must die with you, I will never disown you!” And they all said the same.
<verse eID="Mark.14.31" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.14.32" osisID="Mark.14.32" n="32" />Presently they came to a garden known as Gethsemane, and Jesus said to his disciples <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Sit down here while I pray.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.14.32" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.33" osisID="Mark.14.33" n="33" />He took with him Peter, James, and John; and began to show signs of great dismay and deep distress of mind.
<verse eID="Mark.14.33" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.34" osisID="Mark.14.34" n="34" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“I am sad at heart,”</q>  he said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“sad even to death; wait here, and watch.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.14.34" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.35" osisID="Mark.14.35" n="35" />Going on a little further, he threw himself on the ground, and began to pray that, if it were possible, he might be spared that hour.
<verse eID="Mark.14.35" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.36" osisID="Mark.14.36" n="36" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Abba, Father,”</q>  he said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“all things are possible to you; take away this cup from me; yet, not what I will, but what you will.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.14.36" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.14.37" osisID="Mark.14.37" n="37" />Then he came and found the three apostles asleep. <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Simon,”</q>  he said to Peter, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“are you asleep? Couldn’t you watch for one hour?</q>
<verse eID="Mark.14.37" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.38" osisID="Mark.14.38" n="38" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">Watch and pray,” he said to them all, “so that you may not fall into temptation. True, the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.14.38" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.39" osisID="Mark.14.39" n="39" />Again he went away, and prayed in the same words;
<verse eID="Mark.14.39" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.40" osisID="Mark.14.40" n="40" />and coming back again he found them asleep, for their eyes were heavy; and they did not know what to say to him.
<verse eID="Mark.14.40" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.14.41" osisID="Mark.14.41" n="41" />A third time he came, and said to them, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Sleep on now, and rest yourselves. Enough! My time has come. Look, the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of wicked people.</q>
<verse eID="Mark.14.41" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.42" osisID="Mark.14.42" n="42" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">Up, and let us be going. Look! My betrayer is close at hand.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.14.42" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.14.43" osisID="Mark.14.43" n="43" />And just then, while he was still speaking, Judas, who was one of the Twelve, came up; and with him a crowd of people, with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests, the teachers of the Law, and the elders.
<verse eID="Mark.14.43" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.44" osisID="Mark.14.44" n="44" />Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them. “The man whom I kiss,” he had said, “will be the one; arrest him and take him away safely.”
<verse eID="Mark.14.44" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.45" osisID="Mark.14.45" n="45" />As soon as Judas came, he went up to Jesus at once, and said, “Rabbi!” and kissed him.
<verse eID="Mark.14.45" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.46" osisID="Mark.14.46" n="46" />Then the men seized Jesus, and arrested him.
<verse eID="Mark.14.46" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.14.47" osisID="Mark.14.47" n="47" />One of those who were standing by drew his sword, and struck at the high priest’s servant, and cut off his ear.
<verse eID="Mark.14.47" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.48" osisID="Mark.14.48" n="48" />But Jesus spoke up, and said to the men, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Have you come out, as if after a robber, with swords and clubs, to take me?</q>
<verse eID="Mark.14.48" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.49" osisID="Mark.14.49" n="49" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">I have been among you day after day in the Temple Courts teaching, and yet you did not arrest me; but this is in fulfillment of the scriptures.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.14.49" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.50" osisID="Mark.14.50" n="50" />And all the apostles deserted him and fled.
<verse eID="Mark.14.50" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.51" osisID="Mark.14.51" n="51" />One young man did indeed follow him, wrapped only in a linen sheet. They tried to arrest him;
<verse eID="Mark.14.51" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.52" osisID="Mark.14.52" n="52" />but he left the sheet in their hands, and fled naked.
<verse eID="Mark.14.52" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.14.53" osisID="Mark.14.53" n="53" />Then they took Jesus to the high priest; and all the chief priests, elders, and the teachers of the Law assembled.
<verse eID="Mark.14.53" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.54" osisID="Mark.14.54" n="54" />Peter, who had followed Jesus at a distance into the courtyard of the high priest, was sitting there among the police officers, warming himself at the blaze of the fire.
<verse eID="Mark.14.54" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.14.55" osisID="Mark.14.55" n="55" />Meanwhile the chief priest and the whole of the High Council were trying to get such evidence against Jesus as would warrant his being put to death, but they could not find any;
<verse eID="Mark.14.55" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.56" osisID="Mark.14.56" n="56" />for, though there were many who gave false evidence against him, yet their evidence did not agree.
<verse eID="Mark.14.56" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.57" osisID="Mark.14.57" n="57" />Presently some men stood up, and gave this false evidence against him –
<verse eID="Mark.14.57" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.58" osisID="Mark.14.58" n="58" />“We ourselves heard him say ‘I will destroy this Temple made with hands, and in three days build another made without hands.’”
<verse eID="Mark.14.58" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.59" osisID="Mark.14.59" n="59" />Yet not even on that point did their evidence agree.
<verse eID="Mark.14.59" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.14.60" osisID="Mark.14.60" n="60" />Then the high priest stood forward, and questioned Jesus. “Have you no answer to make?” he asked. “What is this evidence which these men are giving against you?”
<verse eID="Mark.14.60" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.61" osisID="Mark.14.61" n="61" />But Jesus remained silent, and made no answer.
</p>
<p>
A second time the high priest questioned him. “Are you,” he asked, “the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?”
<verse eID="Mark.14.61" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.14.62" osisID="Mark.14.62" n="62" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“I am,”</q>  replied Jesus, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“and you will all see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of the Almighty, and coming in the clouds of heaven.”</q>
<verse eID="Mark.14.62" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.63" osisID="Mark.14.63" n="63" />At this the high priest tore his vestments. “Why do we want any more witnesses?” he exclaimed.
<verse eID="Mark.14.63" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.64" osisID="Mark.14.64" n="64" />“You heard his blasphemy? What is your verdict?” They all condemned him, declaring that he deserved death.
<verse eID="Mark.14.64" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.14.65" osisID="Mark.14.65" n="65" />Some of those present began to spit at him, and to blindfold his eyes, and strike him, saying, as they did so, “Now play the prophet!” and even the police officers received him with blows.
<verse eID="Mark.14.65" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.14.66" osisID="Mark.14.66" n="66" />While Peter was in the courtyard down below, one of the high priest’s maidservants came up;
<verse eID="Mark.14.66" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.67" osisID="Mark.14.67" n="67" />and, seeing Peter warming himself, she looked closely at him, and exclaimed, “Why, you were with Jesus, the Nazarene!”
<verse eID="Mark.14.67" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.68" osisID="Mark.14.68" n="68" />But Peter denied it. “I do not know or understand what you mean,” he replied. Then he went out into the porch;
<verse eID="Mark.14.68" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.69" osisID="Mark.14.69" n="69" />and there the maidservant, on seeing him, began to say again to the bystanders, “This is one of them!”
<verse eID="Mark.14.69" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.70" osisID="Mark.14.70" n="70" />But Peter again denied it.
</p>
<p>
Soon afterward the bystanders again said to him, “You certainly are one of them; why you are a Galilean!”
<verse eID="Mark.14.70" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.71" osisID="Mark.14.71" n="71" />But he said to them, “I swear that I do not know the man you are talking about! May God punish me if I am lying!”
<verse eID="Mark.14.71" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.72" osisID="Mark.14.72" n="72" />At that moment, for the second time, a cock crowed; and Peter remembered the words that Jesus had said to him – <q who="Jesus" marker="">‘Before a cock has crowed twice, you will disown me three times’;</q>  and, as he thought of it, he began to weep.
<verse eID="Mark.14.72" />
<chapter eID="Mark.14" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Mark.15" osisID="Mark.15" n="15" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.1" osisID="Mark.15.1" n="1" />As soon as it was daylight, the chief priests, after holding a consultation with elders and teachers of the Law – that is to say, the whole High Council – put Jesus in chains, and took him away, and gave him up to Pilate.
<verse eID="Mark.15.1" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.2" osisID="Mark.15.2" n="2" />“Are you the king of the Jews?” asked Pilate. <q who="Jesus" marker="">“It is true,”</q>  replied Jesus.
<verse eID="Mark.15.2" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.3" osisID="Mark.15.3" n="3" />Then the chief priests brought a number of charges against him.
<verse eID="Mark.15.3" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.4" osisID="Mark.15.4" n="4" />So Pilate questioned Jesus again. “Have you no reply to make?” he asked. “Listen, how many charges they are bringing against you.”
<verse eID="Mark.15.4" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.5" osisID="Mark.15.5" n="5" />But Jesus still made no reply whatever; at which Pilate was astonished.
<verse eID="Mark.15.5" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.15.6" osisID="Mark.15.6" n="6" />Now, at the feast, Pilate used to grant the people the release of any one prisoner whom they might ask for.
<verse eID="Mark.15.6" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.7" osisID="Mark.15.7" n="7" />A man called Barabbas was in prison, with the rioters who had committed murder during a riot.
<verse eID="Mark.15.7" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.8" osisID="Mark.15.8" n="8" />So, when the crowd went up and began to ask Pilate to follow his usual custom,
<verse eID="Mark.15.8" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.9" osisID="Mark.15.9" n="9" />he answered, “Do you want me to release the ‘king of the Jews’ for you?”
<verse eID="Mark.15.9" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.10" osisID="Mark.15.10" n="10" />For he was aware that it was out of jealousy that the chief priests had given Jesus up to him.
<verse eID="Mark.15.10" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.11" osisID="Mark.15.11" n="11" />But the chief priests incited the crowd to get Barabbas released instead.
<verse eID="Mark.15.11" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.12" osisID="Mark.15.12" n="12" />Pilate, however, spoke to them again, “What should I do then with the man whom you call the ‘king of the Jews’?”
<verse eID="Mark.15.12" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.13" osisID="Mark.15.13" n="13" />Again they shouted, “Crucify him!”
<verse eID="Mark.15.13" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.15.14" osisID="Mark.15.14" n="14" />“Why, what harm has he done?” Pilate kept saying to them. But they shouted furiously, “Crucify him!”
<verse eID="Mark.15.14" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.15" osisID="Mark.15.15" n="15" />And Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released Barabbas to them, and, after scourging Jesus, gave him up to be crucified.
<verse eID="Mark.15.15" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.15.16" osisID="Mark.15.16" n="16" />The soldiers then took Jesus away into the courtyard – that is the Government house – and they called the whole garrison together.
<verse eID="Mark.15.16" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.17" osisID="Mark.15.17" n="17" />They dressed him in a purple robe, and, having twisted a crown of thorns, put it on him,
<verse eID="Mark.15.17" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.18" osisID="Mark.15.18" n="18" />and then began to salute him. “Long life to you, king of the Jews!” they said.
<verse eID="Mark.15.18" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.19" osisID="Mark.15.19" n="19" />And they kept striking him on the head with a rod, spitting at him, and bowing to the ground before him – going down on their knees;
<verse eID="Mark.15.19" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.20" osisID="Mark.15.20" n="20" />and, when they had left off mocking him, they took off the purple robe, and put his own clothes on him.
<verse eID="Mark.15.20" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.15.21" osisID="Mark.15.21" n="21" />They led Jesus out to crucify him; and they compelled a passer-by, Simon from Cyrene, who was on his way in from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go with them to carry his cross.
<verse eID="Mark.15.21" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.15.22" osisID="Mark.15.22" n="22" />They brought Jesus to the place which was known as Golgotha – a name which means ‘place of a Skull.’
<verse eID="Mark.15.22" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.23" osisID="Mark.15.23" n="23" />There they offered him drugged wine; but Jesus refused it.
<verse eID="Mark.15.23" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.24" osisID="Mark.15.24" n="24" />Then they crucified him, and divided his clothes among them, casting lots for them, to settle what each should take.
<verse eID="Mark.15.24" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.15.25" osisID="Mark.15.25" n="25" />It was nine in the morning when they crucified him.
<verse eID="Mark.15.25" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.26" osisID="Mark.15.26" n="26" />The words of the charge against him, written up over his head, read – ‘THE KING OF THE JEWS.’
<verse eID="Mark.15.26" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.27" osisID="Mark.15.27" n="27" />And with him they crucified two robbers, one on the right, and the other on the left.
<verse eID="Mark.15.27" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.28" osisID="Mark.15.28" n="28" /><note placement="foot"><reference type="annotateRef">15:28 </reference>Some later manuscripts add: And the scripture was fulfilled that says, ‘He was counted among outlaws.’</note>
<verse eID="Mark.15.28" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.15.29" osisID="Mark.15.29" n="29" />The passers-by railed at him, shaking their heads, as they said, “Ah! You who would destroy the Temple and build one in three days,
<verse eID="Mark.15.29" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.30" osisID="Mark.15.30" n="30" />come down from the cross and save yourself!”
<verse eID="Mark.15.30" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.31" osisID="Mark.15.31" n="31" />In the same way the chief priests, with the teachers of the Law, said to one another in mockery,
<verse eID="Mark.15.31" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.32" osisID="Mark.15.32" n="32" />“He saved others, but he cannot save himself! Let the Christ, the ‘king of Israel,’ come down from the cross now so that we can see it and believe.” Even the men who had been crucified with Jesus insulted him.
<verse eID="Mark.15.32" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.15.33" osisID="Mark.15.33" n="33" />At midday, a darkness came over the whole country, lasting until three in the afternoon.
<verse eID="Mark.15.33" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.34" osisID="Mark.15.34" n="34" />And, at three, Jesus called out loudly, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Eloi, Eloi, lama sabacthani?”</q>  which means <q who="Jesus" marker="">‘My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?’</q>
<verse eID="Mark.15.34" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.35" osisID="Mark.15.35" n="35" />Some of those standing around heard this, and said, “Listen! He is calling for Elijah!”
<verse eID="Mark.15.35" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.36" osisID="Mark.15.36" n="36" />And a man ran, and, soaking a sponge in common wine, put it on the end of a rod, and offered it to him to drink, saying as he did so, “Wait and let us see if Elijah is coming to take him down.”
<verse eID="Mark.15.36" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.37" osisID="Mark.15.37" n="37" />But Jesus, giving a loud cry, breathed his last.
<verse eID="Mark.15.37" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.38" osisID="Mark.15.38" n="38" />The Temple curtain was torn in two from top to bottom.
<verse eID="Mark.15.38" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.39" osisID="Mark.15.39" n="39" />The Roman officer, who was standing facing Jesus, on seeing the way in which he breathed his last, exclaimed, “This man must indeed have been God’s son!”
<verse eID="Mark.15.39" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.15.40" osisID="Mark.15.40" n="40" />There were some women also watching from a distance, among them being Mary of Magdala, Mary the mother of James the Little and of Joseph, and Salome –
<verse eID="Mark.15.40" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.41" osisID="Mark.15.41" n="41" />all of whom used to accompany Jesus when he was in Galilee, and give him support – besides many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem.
<verse eID="Mark.15.41" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Mark.15.42" osisID="Mark.15.42" n="42" />The evening had already fallen, when, as it was the Preparation day – the day before the Sabbath –
<verse eID="Mark.15.42" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.43" osisID="Mark.15.43" n="43" />Joseph from Ramah, a councillor of good position, who was himself living in expectation of the kingdom of God, came and ventured to go in to see Pilate, and to ask for the body of Jesus.
<verse eID="Mark.15.43" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.44" osisID="Mark.15.44" n="44" />But Pilate was surprised to hear that he had already died. So he sent for the officer, and asked if he were already dead;
<verse eID="Mark.15.44" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.45" osisID="Mark.15.45" n="45" />and, on learning from the officer that it was so, he gave the corpse to Joseph.
<verse eID="Mark.15.45" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.46" osisID="Mark.15.46" n="46" />Joseph, having bought a linen sheet, took Jesus down, and wound the sheet around him, and laid him in a tomb which had been cut out of the rock; and then rolled a stone up against the entrance of the tomb.
<verse eID="Mark.15.46" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.47" osisID="Mark.15.47" n="47" />Mary of Magdala and Mary, the mother of Joseph, were watching to see where he was laid.

<verse sID="Mark.16.3" osisID="Mark.16.3" n="3" />They were saying to one another, “Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?”
<verse eID="Mark.16.3" />
<verse sID="Mark.16.4" osisID="Mark.16.4" n="4" />But, on looking up, they saw that the stone had already been rolled back; it was a very large one.
<verse eID="Mark.16.4" />
<verse sID="Mark.16.5" osisID="Mark.16.5" n="5" />Going into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on their right, in a white robe, and they were dismayed; but he said to them,
<verse eID="Mark.16.5" />
<verse sID="Mark.16.6" osisID="Mark.16.6" n="6" />“Do not be dismayed; you are looking for Jesus, the Nazarene, who has been crucified; he has risen, he is not here! Look! Here is the place where they laid him.
<verse eID="Mark.16.6" />
<verse sID="Mark.16.7" osisID="Mark.16.7" n="7" />But go, and say to his disciples and to Peter ‘He is going before you into Galilee; there you will see him, as he told you.’”
<verse eID="Mark.16.7" />
<verse sID="Mark.16.8" osisID="Mark.16.8" n="8" />They went out, and fled from the tomb, for they were trembling and bewildered; and they did not say a word to anyone, for they were frightened.

<verse sID="Mark.16.9" osisID="Mark.16.9" n="9" />After his rising again, early on the first day of the week, Jesus appeared first of all to Mary of Magdala, from whom he had driven out seven demons.
<verse eID="Mark.16.9" />
<verse sID="Mark.16.10" osisID="Mark.16.10" n="10" />She went and told the news to those who had been with him and who were now in sorrow and tears;
<verse eID="Mark.16.10" />
<verse sID="Mark.16.11" osisID="Mark.16.11" n="11" />yet even they, when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, did not believe it.
<verse eID="Mark.16.11" />
<verse sID="Mark.16.12" osisID="Mark.16.12" n="12" />Afterward, altered in appearance, he made himself known to two of them, as they were walking, on their way into the country.
<verse eID="Mark.16.12" />
<verse sID="Mark.16.13" osisID="Mark.16.13" n="13" />They also went and told the rest, but they did not believe even them.
<verse eID="Mark.16.13" />
<verse sID="Mark.16.14" osisID="Mark.16.14" n="14" />Later on, he made himself known to the Eleven themselves as they were at a meal, and reproached them with their want of faith and their stubbornness, because they did not believe those who had seen him after he had risen from the dead.
<verse eID="Mark.16.14" />
<verse sID="Mark.16.15" osisID="Mark.16.15" n="15" />Then he said to them, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Go into all the world, and proclaim the good news to all creation.</q>

<verse eID="Mark.16.18" />
<verse sID="Mark.16.19" osisID="Mark.16.19" n="19" />So the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and sat at the right hand of God.
<verse eID="Mark.16.19" />
<verse sID="Mark.16.20" osisID="Mark.16.20" n="20" />But they set out, and made the proclamation everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the message by the signs which attended it.

But all that had been revealed to them they reported briefly to Peter and his companions. Afterward Jesus himself sent them out, from east to west, the sacred and imperishable proclamation of eternal salvation.

<p>
Many attempts have been already made to draw up an account of those events which have reached their conclusion among us,
<verse eID="Luke.1.1" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.2" osisID="Luke.1.2" n="2" />just as they were reported to us by those who from the beginning were eye-witnesses, and afterward became bearers of the message.
<verse eID="Luke.1.2" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.3" osisID="Luke.1.3" n="3" />And, therefore, I also, since I have investigated all these events with great care from their very beginning, have resolved to write a connected history of them for you,

<verse sID="Luke.1.5" osisID="Luke.1.5" n="5" />In the reign of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the division called after Abijah. His wife, whose name was Elizabeth, was also a descendant of Aaron.
<verse eID="Luke.1.5" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.6" osisID="Luke.1.6" n="6" />They were both righteous people, who lived blameless lives, guiding their steps by all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord.
<verse eID="Luke.1.6" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.7" osisID="Luke.1.7" n="7" />But they had no child, Elizabeth being barren; and both of them were advanced in years.
<verse eID="Luke.1.7" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.1.8" osisID="Luke.1.8" n="8" />One day, when Zechariah was officiating as priest before God, during the turn of his division,
<verse eID="Luke.1.8" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.9" osisID="Luke.1.9" n="9" />it fell to him by lot, in accordance with the practice among the priests, to go into the Temple of the Lord and burn incense;
<verse eID="Luke.1.9" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.10" osisID="Luke.1.10" n="10" />and, as it was the Hour of Incense, the people were all praying outside.
<verse eID="Luke.1.10" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.11" osisID="Luke.1.11" n="11" />And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right of the Altar of Incense.
<verse eID="Luke.1.11" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.12" osisID="Luke.1.12" n="12" />Zechariah was startled at the sight and was awe-struck.
<verse eID="Luke.1.12" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.13" osisID="Luke.1.13" n="13" />But the angel said to him, “Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, whom you will call by the name John.
<verse eID="Luke.1.13" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.14" osisID="Luke.1.14" n="14" />He will be to you a joy and a delight; and many will rejoice over his birth.
<verse eID="Luke.1.14" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.15" osisID="Luke.1.15" n="15" />For he will be great in the sight of the Lord; he will not drink any wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit from the very hour of his birth,
<verse eID="Luke.1.15" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.16" osisID="Luke.1.16" n="16" />and will reconcile many of the Israelites to the Lord their God.
<verse eID="Luke.1.16" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.17" osisID="Luke.1.17" n="17" />He will go before him in the spirit and with the power of Elijah, to reconcile fathers to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, and so make ready for the Lord a people prepared for him.”
<verse eID="Luke.1.17" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.1.18" osisID="Luke.1.18" n="18" />“How can I be sure of this?” Zechariah asked the angel. “For I am an old man and my wife is advanced in years.”
<verse eID="Luke.1.18" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.1.19" osisID="Luke.1.19" n="19" />“I am Gabriel,” the angel answered, “who stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news.
<verse eID="Luke.1.19" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.20" osisID="Luke.1.20" n="20" />And now you will be silent and unable to speak until the day when this takes place, because you did not believe what I said, though my words will be fulfilled in due course.”
<verse eID="Luke.1.20" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.1.21" osisID="Luke.1.21" n="21" />Meanwhile the people were watching for Zechariah, wondering at his remaining so long in the Temple.
<verse eID="Luke.1.21" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.22" osisID="Luke.1.22" n="22" />When he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision there. But Zechariah kept making signs to them, and remained dumb.
<verse eID="Luke.1.22" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.23" osisID="Luke.1.23" n="23" />And, as soon as his term of service was finished, he returned home.
<verse eID="Luke.1.23" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.24" osisID="Luke.1.24" n="24" />After this his wife, Elizabeth, became pregnant and lived in seclusion for five months.
<verse eID="Luke.1.24" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.25" osisID="Luke.1.25" n="25" />“The Lord has done this for me,” she said, “he has shown me kindness and taken away the public disgrace of childlessness under which I have been living.”
<verse eID="Luke.1.25" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.1.26" osisID="Luke.1.26" n="26" />Six months later the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth,
<verse eID="Luke.1.26" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.27" osisID="Luke.1.27" n="27" />to a maiden there who was engaged to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. Her name was Mary.
<verse eID="Luke.1.27" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.28" osisID="Luke.1.28" n="28" />Gabriel came into her presence and greeted her, saying, “You have been shown great favor – the Lord is with you.”
<verse eID="Luke.1.28" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.1.29" osisID="Luke.1.29" n="29" />Mary was much disturbed at his words, and was wondering to herself what such a greeting could mean,
<verse eID="Luke.1.29" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.30" osisID="Luke.1.30" n="30" />when the angel spoke again, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.
<verse eID="Luke.1.30" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.31" osisID="Luke.1.31" n="31" />And now, you will conceive and give birth to a son, and you will give him the name Jesus.
<verse eID="Luke.1.31" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.32" osisID="Luke.1.32" n="32" />The child will be great and will be called ‘Son of the Most High,’ and the Lord God will give him the throne of his ancestor David,
<verse eID="Luke.1.32" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.33" osisID="Luke.1.33" n="33" />and he will reign over the descendants of Jacob for ever; And to his kingdom there will be no end.”
<verse eID="Luke.1.33" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.1.34" osisID="Luke.1.34" n="34" />“How can this be?” Mary asked the angel. “For I have no husband.”
<verse eID="Luke.1.34" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.1.35" osisID="Luke.1.35" n="35" />“The Holy Spirit will descend on you,” answered the angel, “and the Power of the Most High will overshadow you; and therefore the child will be called ‘holy,’ and ‘Son of God.’
<verse eID="Luke.1.35" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.36" osisID="Luke.1.36" n="36" />And Elizabeth, your cousin, is herself also expecting a son in her old age; and it is now the sixth month with her, though she is called barren;
<verse eID="Luke.1.36" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.37" osisID="Luke.1.37" n="37" />for no promise from God will fail to be fulfilled.”
<verse eID="Luke.1.37" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.1.38" osisID="Luke.1.38" n="38" />“I am the servant of the Lord,” exclaimed Mary. “Let it be with me as you have said.” Then the angel left her.
<verse eID="Luke.1.38" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.1.39" osisID="Luke.1.39" n="39" />Soon after this Mary set out, and made her way quickly into the hill-country, to a town in Judah;
<verse eID="Luke.1.39" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.40" osisID="Luke.1.40" n="40" />and there she went into Zechariah’s house and greeted Elizabeth.
<verse eID="Luke.1.40" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.41" osisID="Luke.1.41" n="41" />When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the child moved within her, and Elizabeth herself was filled with the Holy Spirit,
<verse eID="Luke.1.41" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.42" osisID="Luke.1.42" n="42" />and cried aloud, “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is your unborn child!
<verse eID="Luke.1.42" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.43" osisID="Luke.1.43" n="43" />But how have I this honor, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
<verse eID="Luke.1.43" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.44" osisID="Luke.1.44" n="44" />For, as soon as your greeting reached my ears, the child moved within me with delight!
<verse eID="Luke.1.44" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.45" osisID="Luke.1.45" n="45" />Happy indeed is she who believed that the promise which she received from the Lord would be fulfilled.”
<verse eID="Luke.1.45" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.1.46" osisID="Luke.1.46" n="46" />And Mary said:

<verse eID="Luke.1.58" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.59" osisID="Luke.1.59" n="59" />A week later they met to circumcise the child, and were about to call him Zechariah after his father,

<verse sID="Luke.1.62" osisID="Luke.1.62" n="62" />and they made signs to the child’s father, to find out what he wished the child to be called.
<verse eID="Luke.1.62" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.63" osisID="Luke.1.63" n="63" />Asking for a writing-tablet, he wrote the words – ‘His name is John.’ Everyone was surprised

<verse sID="Luke.1.64" osisID="Luke.1.64" n="64" />and immediately Zechariah recovered his voice and the use of his tongue, and began to bless God.

<verse sID="Luke.1.65" osisID="Luke.1.65" n="65" />All their neighbors were awe-struck at this, and throughout the hill-country of Judea the whole story was much talked about.

<verse eID="Luke.2.6" />
<verse sID="Luke.2.7" osisID="Luke.2.7" n="7" />and she gave birth to her first child, a son. And because there was no room for them in the inn, she swathed him around and laid him in a manger.
<verse eID="Luke.2.7" />
<verse sID="Luke.2.8" osisID="Luke.2.8" n="8" />In that same country-side were shepherds out in the open fields, watching their flocks that night,
<verse eID="Luke.2.8" />
<verse sID="Luke.2.9" osisID="Luke.2.9" n="9" />when an angel of the Lord suddenly stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them; and they were seized with fear.
<verse eID="Luke.2.9" />
<verse sID="Luke.2.10" osisID="Luke.2.10" n="10" />“Have no fear,” the angel said. “For I bring you good news of a great joy in store for all the nation.
<verse eID="Luke.2.10" />
<verse sID="Luke.2.11" osisID="Luke.2.11" n="11" />This day there has been born to you, in the town of David, a Savior, who is Christ and Lord.
<verse eID="Luke.2.11" />
<verse sID="Luke.2.12" osisID="Luke.2.12" n="12" />And this will be the sign for you. You will find the infant swathed, and lying in a manger.”
<verse eID="Luke.2.12" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.2.13" osisID="Luke.2.13" n="13" />Then suddenly there appeared with the angel a multitude of the heavenly Host, praising God, and singing –
<verse eID="Luke.2.13" />
</p>

<l level="1">
<verse sID="Luke.2.14" osisID="Luke.2.14" n="14" />“glory to God on high,</l>

</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Luke.2.15" osisID="Luke.2.15" n="15" />Now, when the angels had left them and gone back to heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let us go at once to Bethlehem, and see this thing that has happened, of which the Lord has told us.”
<verse eID="Luke.2.15" />
<verse sID="Luke.2.16" osisID="Luke.2.16" n="16" />So they went quickly, and found Mary and Joseph, and the infant lying in a manger;
<verse eID="Luke.2.16" />
<verse sID="Luke.2.17" osisID="Luke.2.17" n="17" />and, when they saw it, they told of all that had been said to them about this child.
<verse eID="Luke.2.17" />
<verse sID="Luke.2.18" osisID="Luke.2.18" n="18" />All who heard the shepherds were astonished at their story,
<verse eID="Luke.2.18" />
<verse sID="Luke.2.19" osisID="Luke.2.19" n="19" />while Mary treasured up all that they said, and thought about it often in her thoughts.
<verse eID="Luke.2.19" />
<verse sID="Luke.2.20" osisID="Luke.2.20" n="20" />And the shepherds went back, giving glory and praise to God for all that they had heard and seen. It had all happened as they had been told.
<verse eID="Luke.2.20" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.2.21" osisID="Luke.2.21" n="21" />Eight days after the birth of the child, when it was time to circumcise him, he received the name Jesus – the name given him by the angel before his conception.
<verse eID="Luke.2.21" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.2.22" osisID="Luke.2.22" n="22" />When the period of purification of mother and child, required by the Law of Moses, came to an end, his parents took the child up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord,

<verse eID="Luke.2.24" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.2.25" osisID="Luke.2.25" n="25" />There was at that time in Jerusalem a man named Simeon, a righteous and devout man, who lived in constant expectation of the Consolation of Israel, and under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.
<verse eID="Luke.2.25" />
<verse sID="Luke.2.26" osisID="Luke.2.26" n="26" />It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he should not die until he had seen the Lord’s Christ.
<verse eID="Luke.2.26" />
<verse sID="Luke.2.27" osisID="Luke.2.27" n="27" />Moved by the Spirit, Simeon came into the Temple Courts, and, when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him what was customary under the Law,
<verse eID="Luke.2.27" />
<verse sID="Luke.2.28" osisID="Luke.2.28" n="28" />Simeon himself took the child in his arms, and blessed God, and said:

</lg>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.2.33" osisID="Luke.2.33" n="33" />While the child’s father and mother were wondering at what was said about him,
<verse eID="Luke.2.33" />
<verse sID="Luke.2.34" osisID="Luke.2.34" n="34" />Simeon gave them his blessing, and said to Mary, the child’s mother, “This child is appointed to be the cause of the fall and rise of many in Israel, and to be a sign much spoken against –
<verse eID="Luke.2.34" />
<verse sID="Luke.2.35" osisID="Luke.2.35" n="35" />Yes, the sword will pierce your own heart – and so the thoughts in many minds will be disclosed.”
<verse eID="Luke.2.35" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.2.36" osisID="Luke.2.36" n="36" />There was also a prophet named Hannah, a daughter of Phanuel and of the tribe of Asher. She was far advanced in years, having lived with her husband for seven years after marriage,
<verse eID="Luke.2.36" />
<verse sID="Luke.2.37" osisID="Luke.2.37" n="37" />and then a widow, until she had reached the age of eighty-four. She never left the Temple Courts, but, fasting and praying, worshiped God night and day.
<verse eID="Luke.2.37" />
<verse sID="Luke.2.38" osisID="Luke.2.38" n="38" />At that moment she came up, and began publicly to thank God and to speak about the child to all who were looking for the deliverance of Jerusalem.
<verse eID="Luke.2.38" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.2.39" osisID="Luke.2.39" n="39" />When the child’s parents had done everything required by the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee to their own town of Nazareth.
<verse eID="Luke.2.39" />
<verse sID="Luke.2.40" osisID="Luke.2.40" n="40" />The child grew and became strong and wise, and the blessing of God was on him.

<verse eID="Luke.2.41" />
<verse sID="Luke.2.42" osisID="Luke.2.42" n="42" />When Jesus was twelve years old, they went according to custom to Jerusalem,

<verse eID="Luke.2.43" />
<verse sID="Luke.2.44" osisID="Luke.2.44" n="44" />Thinking that he was with their fellow travelers, they went one day’s journey before searching for him among their relatives and acquaintances;
<verse eID="Luke.2.44" />
<verse sID="Luke.2.45" osisID="Luke.2.45" n="45" />and then, as they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem, searching everywhere for him.
<verse eID="Luke.2.45" />
<verse sID="Luke.2.46" osisID="Luke.2.46" n="46" />It was not until the third day that they found him in the Temple Courts, sitting among the teachers, now listening to them, now asking them questions.

<verse eID="Luke.2.51" />
<verse sID="Luke.2.52" osisID="Luke.2.52" n="52" />And Jesus grew in wisdom as he grew in years, and gained the blessing of God and people.

<!-- s --><title>The Preparation</title>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.3.1" osisID="Luke.3.1" n="1" />In the fifteenth year of the reign of the Emperor Tiberius, when Pontius Pilate was Governor of Judea, Herod Ruler of Galilee, his brother Philip Ruler of the territory comprising Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias Ruler of Abilene,
<verse eID="Luke.3.1" />
<verse sID="Luke.3.2" osisID="Luke.3.2" n="2" />and when Annas and Caiaphas were high priests, a command from God came to John, the son of Zechariah, while he was in the wilderness.
<verse eID="Luke.3.2" />
<verse sID="Luke.3.3" osisID="Luke.3.3" n="3" />And John went through the whole district of the Jordan, proclaiming baptism on repentance, for the forgiveness of sins.
<verse eID="Luke.3.3" />
<verse sID="Luke.3.4" osisID="Luke.3.4" n="4" />This was in fulfillment of what is said in the writings of the prophet Isaiah –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness:</l>
<l level="1">“Make ready the way of the Lord,</l>

</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Luke.3.7" osisID="Luke.3.7" n="7" />And John said to the crowds that went to be baptized by him, “You children of snakes! Who has prompted you to seek refuge from the coming judgment?
<verse eID="Luke.3.7" />
<verse sID="Luke.3.8" osisID="Luke.3.8" n="8" />Let your lives, then, prove your repentance; and do not begin to say among yourselves ‘Abraham is our ancestor,’ for I tell you that out of these stones God is able to raise descendants for Abraham!

<verse sID="Luke.3.9" osisID="Luke.3.9" n="9" />Already, indeed, the axe is lying at the root of the trees. Therefore every tree that fails to bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.”

</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.3.10" osisID="Luke.3.10" n="10" />“What are we to do then?” the people asked.
<verse eID="Luke.3.10" />
<verse sID="Luke.3.11" osisID="Luke.3.11" n="11" />“Let anyone who has two coats,” answered John, “share with the person who has none; and anyone who has food do the same.”
<verse eID="Luke.3.11" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.3.12" osisID="Luke.3.12" n="12" />Even tax-gatherers came to be baptized, and said to John, “Teacher, what are we to do?”
<verse eID="Luke.3.12" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.3.13" osisID="Luke.3.13" n="13" />“Do not collect more than you have authority to demand,” John answered.
<verse eID="Luke.3.13" />
<verse sID="Luke.3.14" osisID="Luke.3.14" n="14" />And when some soldiers on active service asked “And we – what are we to do?” he said, “Never use violence, or exact anything by false accusation; and be content with your pay.”
<verse eID="Luke.3.14" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.3.15" osisID="Luke.3.15" n="15" />Then, while the people were in suspense, and were all debating with themselves whether John could be the Christ,
<verse eID="Luke.3.15" />
<verse sID="Luke.3.16" osisID="Luke.3.16" n="16" />John, addressing them all, said, “I, indeed, baptize you with water; but there is coming one more powerful than I, and I am not fit even to unfasten his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.
<verse eID="Luke.3.16" />
<verse sID="Luke.3.17" osisID="Luke.3.17" n="17" />His winnowing-fan is in his hand so that he may clear his threshing-floor, and store the grain in his barn, but the chaff he will burn with a fire that cannot be put out.”
<verse eID="Luke.3.17" />

<p>
<verse sID="Luke.3.18" osisID="Luke.3.18" n="18" />And so with many different appeals John told his good news to the people.

<verse sID="Luke.3.19" osisID="Luke.3.19" n="19" />But Prince Herod, being rebuked by John respecting Herodias, the wife of Herod’s brother, and for all the evil things that he had done,

<verse sID="Luke.3.20" osisID="Luke.3.20" n="20" />crowned them all by shutting John up in prison.
<verse eID="Luke.3.20" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.3.21" osisID="Luke.3.21" n="21" />Now after the baptism of all the people, and when Jesus had been baptized and was still praying, the heavens opened,
<verse eID="Luke.3.21" />
<verse sID="Luke.3.22" osisID="Luke.3.22" n="22" />and the Holy Spirit came down on him in the form of a dove, and from the heavens came a voice – “You are my dearly loved son; you bring me great joy.”

<verse sID="Luke.4.22" osisID="Luke.4.22" n="22" />All who were present spoke well of him, and were astonished at the beautiful words that fell from his lips. “Isn’t Joseph’s son?” they asked.
<verse eID="Luke.4.22" />
<verse sID="Luke.4.23" osisID="Luke.4.23" n="23" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Doubtless,”</q>  said Jesus, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“you will remind me of the saying – ‘Doctor, cure yourself;’ and you will say ‘Do here in your own country all that we have heard that has been done at Capernaum.’</q>
<verse eID="Luke.4.23" />
<verse sID="Luke.4.24" osisID="Luke.4.24" n="24" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">I tell you,”</q>  he continued, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“that no prophet is acceptable in his own country.</q>
<verse eID="Luke.4.24" />
<verse sID="Luke.4.25" osisID="Luke.4.25" n="25" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">There were, doubtless, many widows in Israel in Elijah’s days, when the heavens were closed for three years and six months, and a severe famine prevailed throughout the country;</q>
<verse eID="Luke.4.25" />
<verse sID="Luke.4.26" osisID="Luke.4.26" n="26" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">and yet it was not to one of them that Elijah was sent, but to a widow at Zarephath in Sidonia.</q>
<verse eID="Luke.4.26" />
<verse sID="Luke.4.27" osisID="Luke.4.27" n="27" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha, yet it was not one of them who was made clean, but Naaman the Syrian.”</q>
<verse eID="Luke.4.27" />
<verse sID="Luke.4.28" osisID="Luke.4.28" n="28" />All the people in the synagogue, as they listened to this, became enraged.
<verse eID="Luke.4.28" />
<verse sID="Luke.4.29" osisID="Luke.4.29" n="29" />Starting up, they drove Jesus out of the town, and led him to the brow of the hill on which their town stood, intending to hurl him down.
<verse eID="Luke.4.29" />
<verse sID="Luke.4.30" osisID="Luke.4.30" n="30" />But he passed through the middle of the crowd and went on his way.
<verse eID="Luke.4.30" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.4.31" osisID="Luke.4.31" n="31" />Then Jesus went down to Capernaum, a city in Galilee. On the Sabbath he taught the people.
<verse eID="Luke.4.31" />
<verse sID="Luke.4.32" osisID="Luke.4.32" n="32" />They were amazed at his teaching, because his words were spoken with authority.
<verse eID="Luke.4.32" />
<verse sID="Luke.4.33" osisID="Luke.4.33" n="33" />In the synagogue there was a man with the spirit of a foul demon in him, who called out loudly,
<verse eID="Luke.4.33" />
<verse sID="Luke.4.34" osisID="Luke.4.34" n="34" />“Stop! What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are – the Holy One of God!”
<verse eID="Luke.4.34" />
<verse sID="Luke.4.35" osisID="Luke.4.35" n="35" />But Jesus rebuked the demon. <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Be silent! Come out from him,”</q>  he said. The demon flung the man down in the middle of the people, and then came out from him, without causing him further harm.
<verse eID="Luke.4.35" />
<verse sID="Luke.4.36" osisID="Luke.4.36" n="36" />And they were all lost in amazement, and kept saying to one another, “What words are these? For he gives his commands to the foul spirits with a marvelous authority, and they come out.”
<verse eID="Luke.4.36" />
<verse sID="Luke.4.37" osisID="Luke.4.37" n="37" />And rumors about Jesus traveled through every place in the region.
<verse eID="Luke.4.37" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.4.38" osisID="Luke.4.38" n="38" />On leaving the synagogue, Jesus went into Simon’s house. Now Simon’s mother-in-law was suffering from a severe attack of fever, and they asked Jesus to cure her.
<verse eID="Luke.4.38" />
<verse sID="Luke.4.39" osisID="Luke.4.39" n="39" />Bending over her, he rebuked the fever; the fever left her, and she immediately got up and began to take care of them.
<verse eID="Luke.4.39" />
<verse sID="Luke.4.40" osisID="Luke.4.40" n="40" />At sunset, all who had friends suffering from various diseases took them to Jesus; and he placed his hands on everyone of them and cured them.
<verse eID="Luke.4.40" />
<verse sID="Luke.4.41" osisID="Luke.4.41" n="41" />And even demons came out from many people, screaming ‘You are the Son of God.’ Jesus rebuked them, and would not allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.
<verse eID="Luke.4.41" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.4.42" osisID="Luke.4.42" n="42" />At daybreak, Jesus went out and walked to a lonely spot. But crowds of people began to look for him; and they came to where he was and tried to detain him and prevent his leaving them.
<verse eID="Luke.4.42" />
<verse sID="Luke.4.43" osisID="Luke.4.43" n="43" />Jesus, however, said to them, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“I must take the good news of the kingdom of God to the other town also, for that was why I was sent.”</q>
<verse eID="Luke.4.43" />
<verse sID="Luke.4.44" osisID="Luke.4.44" n="44" />And he continued to make his proclamation in the synagogues of Judea.
<verse eID="Luke.4.44" />
<chapter eID="Luke.4" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Luke.5" osisID="Luke.5" n="5" />
<verse sID="Luke.5.1" osisID="Luke.5.1" n="1" />Once, when the people were pressing around Jesus as they listened to God’s message, he happened to be standing by the shore of the Lake of Gennesaret, and saw two boats close to the shore.
<verse eID="Luke.5.1" />
<verse sID="Luke.5.2" osisID="Luke.5.2" n="2" />The fishermen had gone away from them and were washing the nets.
<verse eID="Luke.5.2" />
<verse sID="Luke.5.3" osisID="Luke.5.3" n="3" />So, getting into one of the boats, which belonged to Simon, Jesus asked him to push off a little way from the shore, and then sat down and taught the people from the boat.
<verse eID="Luke.5.3" />
<verse sID="Luke.5.4" osisID="Luke.5.4" n="4" />When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Push off into deep water, and throw out your nets for a haul.”</q>
<verse eID="Luke.5.4" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.5.5" osisID="Luke.5.5" n="5" />“We have been hard at work all night, Sir,” answered Simon, “and have not caught anything, but, at your bidding, I will throw out the nets.”
<verse eID="Luke.5.5" />
<verse sID="Luke.5.6" osisID="Luke.5.6" n="6" />They did so, and enclosed such a great shoal of fish that their nets began to break.
<verse eID="Luke.5.6" />
<verse sID="Luke.5.7" osisID="Luke.5.7" n="7" />So they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them; and they came and filled both the boats so full of fish that they were almost sinking.
<verse eID="Luke.5.7" />
<verse sID="Luke.5.8" osisID="Luke.5.8" n="8" />When Simon Peter saw this, he threw himself down at Jesus’ knees, exclaiming, “Master, leave me, for I am a sinful man!”
<verse eID="Luke.5.8" />
<verse sID="Luke.5.9" osisID="Luke.5.9" n="9" />For he and all who were with him were lost in amazement at the haul of fish which they had made;
<verse eID="Luke.5.9" />
<verse sID="Luke.5.10" osisID="Luke.5.10" n="10" />and so, too, were James and John, Zebedee’s sons, who were Simon’s partners. <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Do not be afraid,”</q>  Jesus said to Simon, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“from today you will catch people.”</q>
<verse eID="Luke.5.10" />
<verse sID="Luke.5.11" osisID="Luke.5.11" n="11" />And, when they had brought their boats to shore, they left everything, and followed him.
<verse eID="Luke.5.11" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.5.12" osisID="Luke.5.12" n="12" />On one occasion Jesus was staying in a town, when he saw a man who was covered with leprosy. When the leper saw Jesus, he threw himself on his face and implored his help, “Master, if only you are willing, you are able to make me clean.”
<verse eID="Luke.5.12" />
<verse sID="Luke.5.13" osisID="Luke.5.13" n="13" />Stretching out his hand, Jesus touched him, saying as he did so, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“I am willing; become clean.”</q>
</p>
<p>
Instantly the leprosy left the man;
<verse eID="Luke.5.13" />
<verse sID="Luke.5.14" osisID="Luke.5.14" n="14" />and then Jesus impressed on him that he was not to say a word to anyone, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“but,”</q>  he added, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“set out and show yourself to the priest, and make the offerings for your cleansing, in the manner directed by Moses, as evidence of your cure.”</q>
<verse eID="Luke.5.14" />
<verse sID="Luke.5.15" osisID="Luke.5.15" n="15" />However, the story about Jesus spread all the more, and great crowds came together to listen to him, and to be cured of their illnesses;
<verse eID="Luke.5.15" />
<verse sID="Luke.5.16" osisID="Luke.5.16" n="16" />but Jesus used to withdraw to lonely places and pray.
<verse eID="Luke.5.16" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.5.17" osisID="Luke.5.17" n="17" />On one of those days, when Jesus was teaching, some Pharisees and Doctors of the Law were sitting near by. (They had come from all the villages in Galilee and Judea, and from Jerusalem; and the power of the Lord was on Jesus, so that he could work cures.)
<verse eID="Luke.5.17" />
<verse sID="Luke.5.18" osisID="Luke.5.18" n="18" />And there some men brought on a bed a man who was paralyzed. They tried to get him in and lay him before Jesus;
<verse eID="Luke.5.18" />
<verse sID="Luke.5.19" osisID="Luke.5.19" n="19" />but, finding no way of getting him in owing to the crowd, they went up on the roof and lowered him through the tiles, with his pallet, into the middle of the people and in front of Jesus.
<verse eID="Luke.5.19" />
<verse sID="Luke.5.20" osisID="Luke.5.20" n="20" />When he saw their faith, Jesus said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Friend, your sins have been forgiven you.”</q>
<verse eID="Luke.5.20" />
<verse sID="Luke.5.21" osisID="Luke.5.21" n="21" />The teachers of the Law and the Pharisees began debating about this. “Who is this man who speaks so blasphemously?” they asked. “Who can forgive sins except God?”
<verse eID="Luke.5.21" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.5.22" osisID="Luke.5.22" n="22" />When Jesus became aware of the way in which they were debating, he turned to them and exclaimed, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“What are you debating with yourselves?</q>
<verse eID="Luke.5.22" />
<verse sID="Luke.5.23" osisID="Luke.5.23" n="23" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">Which is the easier? – to say ‘Your sins have been forgiven you’? Or to say ‘Get up, and walk’?</q>
<verse eID="Luke.5.23" />
<verse sID="Luke.5.24" osisID="Luke.5.24" n="24" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">But so that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins”</q>  – he spoke to the paralyzed man – <q who="Jesus" marker="">“To you I say, Get up, and take up your pallet, and go to your home.”</q>
<verse eID="Luke.5.24" />
<verse sID="Luke.5.25" osisID="Luke.5.25" n="25" />Instantly the man stood up before their eyes, took up what he had been lying on, and went to his home, praising God.
<verse eID="Luke.5.25" />
<verse sID="Luke.5.26" osisID="Luke.5.26" n="26" />The people, one and all, were lost in amazement, and praised God; and in great awe they said, “We have seen marvelous things today!”
<verse eID="Luke.5.26" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.5.27" osisID="Luke.5.27" n="27" />After this, Jesus went out; and he noticed a tax-gatherer, named Levi, sitting in the tax office, and said to him, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Follow me.”</q>
<verse eID="Luke.5.27" />
<verse sID="Luke.5.28" osisID="Luke.5.28" n="28" />Levi left everything and got up and followed him.
<verse eID="Luke.5.28" />
<verse sID="Luke.5.29" osisID="Luke.5.29" n="29" />And Levi gave a great entertainment at his house, in honor of Jesus; and a large number of tax-gatherers and others were having dinner with them.
<verse eID="Luke.5.29" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.5.30" osisID="Luke.5.30" n="30" />The Pharisees and the teachers of the Law belonging to their party complained of this to the disciples of Jesus.
<verse eID="Luke.5.30" />
<verse sID="Luke.5.31" osisID="Luke.5.31" n="31" />In answer Jesus said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“It is not those who are well who need a doctor, but those who are ill.</q>
<verse eID="Luke.5.31" />
<verse sID="Luke.5.32" osisID="Luke.5.32" n="32" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">I have not come to call the religious, but the outcast, to repent.”</q>
<verse eID="Luke.5.32" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.5.33" osisID="Luke.5.33" n="33" />“John’s disciples,” they said to Jesus, “Often fast and say prayers, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, while yours are eating and drinking!”
<verse eID="Luke.5.33" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.5.34" osisID="Luke.5.34" n="34" />But Jesus answered them, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Can you make the groom’s friends fast while the groom is with them?</q>
<verse eID="Luke.5.34" />
<verse sID="Luke.5.35" osisID="Luke.5.35" n="35" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">But the days will come – a time when the groom will be taken away from them; and they will fast then, when those days come.”</q>
<verse eID="Luke.5.35" />
<verse sID="Luke.5.36" osisID="Luke.5.36" n="36" />Then, as an illustration, Jesus said to them, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“No one ever tears a piece from a new garment and puts it on an old one; for, if they do, they will not only tear the new garment, but the piece from the new one will not match the old.</q>
<verse eID="Luke.5.36" />
<verse sID="Luke.5.37" osisID="Luke.5.37" n="37" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">And no one puts new wine into old wine-skins; for, if they do, the new wine will burst the skins, and the wine itself will run out, and the skins be lost.</q>
<verse eID="Luke.5.37" />
<verse sID="Luke.5.38" osisID="Luke.5.38" n="38" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">But new wine must be put into fresh skins.</q>
<verse eID="Luke.5.38" />
<verse sID="Luke.5.39" osisID="Luke.5.39" n="39" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">No one after drinking old wine wishes for new. ‘No,’ they say, ‘the old is excellent.’”</q>
<verse eID="Luke.5.39" />
<chapter eID="Luke.5" />
<chapter sID="Luke.6" osisID="Luke.6" n="6" />
<lb type="x-p" />
<verse sID="Luke.6.1" osisID="Luke.6.1" n="1" />One Sabbath Jesus was walking through cornfields, and his disciples were picking the ears of wheat, and rubbing them in their hands, and eating them.
<verse eID="Luke.6.1" />
<verse sID="Luke.6.2" osisID="Luke.6.2" n="2" />“Why are you doing what it is not allowable to do on the Sabbath?” asked some of the Pharisees.
<verse eID="Luke.6.2" />
<verse sID="Luke.6.3" osisID="Luke.6.3" n="3" />Jesus’ answer was, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Haven’t you read even of what David did, when he was hungry, he and his companions –</q>
<verse eID="Luke.6.3" />
<verse sID="Luke.6.4" osisID="Luke.6.4" n="4" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">That he went into the house of God, and took the consecrated bread and ate it, and gave some to his companions, though only the priests are allowed to eat it?”</q>
<verse eID="Luke.6.4" />
<verse sID="Luke.6.5" osisID="Luke.6.5" n="5" />Then Jesus added, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“The Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.”</q>
<verse eID="Luke.6.5" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.6.6" osisID="Luke.6.6" n="6" />On another Sabbath Jesus went into the synagogue and taught; and there was a man there whose right hand was withered.
<verse eID="Luke.6.6" />
<verse sID="Luke.6.7" osisID="Luke.6.7" n="7" />The teachers of the Law and the Pharisees watched Jesus closely, to see if he would work cures on the Sabbath, so that they might find a charge to bring against him.
<verse eID="Luke.6.7" />
<verse sID="Luke.6.8" osisID="Luke.6.8" n="8" />Jesus, however, knew what was in the their minds, and said to the man whose hand was withered, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Stand up and come out into the middle.”</q>  The man stood up;
<verse eID="Luke.6.8" />
<verse sID="Luke.6.9" osisID="Luke.6.9" n="9" />and Jesus said to them, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“I ask you, is it allowable to do good on the Sabbath – or harm? To save a life, or let it perish?”</q>
<verse eID="Luke.6.9" />
<verse sID="Luke.6.10" osisID="Luke.6.10" n="10" />Then, looking around at them all, he said to the man, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Stretch out your hand.”</q>  The man did so; and his hand had become sound.
<verse eID="Luke.6.10" />
<verse sID="Luke.6.11" osisID="Luke.6.11" n="11" />But the teachers of the Law and the Pharisees were mad with rage, and consulted together what they could do to Jesus.
<verse eID="Luke.6.11" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.6.12" osisID="Luke.6.12" n="12" />Now about that time, Jesus went out, up the hill, to pray, and spent the whole night in prayer to God.
<verse eID="Luke.6.12" />
<verse sID="Luke.6.13" osisID="Luke.6.13" n="13" />When day came, he summoned his disciples, and chose twelve of them, whom he also named ‘apostles.’
<verse eID="Luke.6.13" />
<verse sID="Luke.6.14" osisID="Luke.6.14" n="14" />They were Simon (whom Jesus also named Peter), and his brother Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew,
<verse eID="Luke.6.14" />
<verse sID="Luke.6.15" osisID="Luke.6.15" n="15" />Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Simon known as the Zealot,
<verse eID="Luke.6.15" />
<verse sID="Luke.6.16" osisID="Luke.6.16" n="16" />Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who proved a traitor.
<verse eID="Luke.6.16" />
<verse sID="Luke.6.17" osisID="Luke.6.17" n="17" />Afterward Jesus came down the hill with them and took his stand on a level place. With him were a large crowd of his disciples, and great numbers of people from the whole of Judea, Jerusalem, and the coast district of Tyre and Sidon,
<verse eID="Luke.6.17" />
<verse sID="Luke.6.18" osisID="Luke.6.18" n="18" />who had come to hear him and to be restored to health. Those, too, who were troubled with foul spirits were cured;
<verse eID="Luke.6.18" />
<verse sID="Luke.6.19" osisID="Luke.6.19" n="19" />and everyone in the crowd was trying to touch him, because a power went out from him which restored them all.
<verse eID="Luke.6.19" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.6.20" osisID="Luke.6.20" n="20" />Then, raising his eyes and looking at his disciples, Jesus said:

<verse sID="Luke.8.26" osisID="Luke.8.26" n="26" />And they reached the region of the Gerasenes, which is on the opposite side to Galilee;
<verse eID="Luke.8.26" />
<verse sID="Luke.8.27" osisID="Luke.8.27" n="27" />and, on getting ashore, Jesus met a man, who had demons in him, coming out of the town. For a long time this man had worn no clothing, and he had not lived in a house, but in the tombs.
<verse eID="Luke.8.27" />
<verse sID="Luke.8.28" osisID="Luke.8.28" n="28" />Catching sight of Jesus, he shrieked out and threw himself down before him, and in a loud voice exclaimed, “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you not to torment me.”
<verse eID="Luke.8.28" />
<verse sID="Luke.8.29" osisID="Luke.8.29" n="29" />For Jesus was commanding the foul spirit to come out of the man. On many occasions it had seized him, and, even when secured with chains and fetters, and watched, he would break through anything that bound him, and be driven by the demon into the Wilds.
<verse eID="Luke.8.29" />

<verse sID="Luke.8.30" osisID="Luke.8.30" n="30" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“What is your name?”</q>  Jesus asked.

“Legion,” he answered (for many demons had taken possession of him);
<verse eID="Luke.8.30" />
<verse sID="Luke.8.31" osisID="Luke.8.31" n="31" />and the demons begged Jesus not to order them away into the bottomless pit.
<verse eID="Luke.8.31" />
<verse sID="Luke.8.32" osisID="Luke.8.32" n="32" />There was a drove of many pigs close by feeding on the hill-side; and the demons begged Jesus to give them leave to enter into them. Jesus gave them leave.
<verse eID="Luke.8.32" />
<verse sID="Luke.8.33" osisID="Luke.8.33" n="33" />They came out from the man and took possession of the pigs; and the drove rushed down the steep slope into the lake and were drowned.
<verse eID="Luke.8.33" />
<verse sID="Luke.8.34" osisID="Luke.8.34" n="34" />When the men who tended them saw what had happened, they ran away, and carried the news to the town, and to the country around.
<verse eID="Luke.8.34" />
<verse sID="Luke.8.35" osisID="Luke.8.35" n="35" />The people went out to see what had happened, and, when they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting, clothed and in his right mind, at Jesus’ feet; and they were awe-struck.
<verse eID="Luke.8.35" />
<verse sID="Luke.8.36" osisID="Luke.8.36" n="36" />Those who had seen it told them how the possessed man had been delivered.
<verse eID="Luke.8.36" />
<verse sID="Luke.8.37" osisID="Luke.8.37" n="37" />Then all the people in the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them, for they were terrified. Jesus got into a boat and returned.
<verse eID="Luke.8.37" />
<verse sID="Luke.8.38" osisID="Luke.8.38" n="38" />The man from whom the demons had gone out begged Jesus to let him be with him; but Jesus sent him away.

<p>
<verse sID="Luke.8.40" osisID="Luke.8.40" n="40" />On his return, Jesus was welcomed by the people; for everyone was looking out for him.
<verse eID="Luke.8.40" />
<verse sID="Luke.8.41" osisID="Luke.8.41" n="41" />And a man named Jairus, who was a synagogue leader, came to Jesus, and threw himself at Jesus’ feet, with entreaties that he would come to his house,
<verse eID="Luke.8.41" />
<verse sID="Luke.8.42" osisID="Luke.8.42" n="42" />because his only daughter, who was about twelve years old, was dying. As Jesus was going, the people were pressing closely around him.

<verse eID="Luke.8.43" />
<verse sID="Luke.8.44" osisID="Luke.8.44" n="44" />came up behind and touched the tassel of his cloak. Instantly the hemorrhage ceased.

<p>
<verse sID="Luke.8.45" osisID="Luke.8.45" n="45" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Who touched me?”</q>  Jesus asked; and, while everyone was denying having done so, Peter exclaimed, “Why, Sir, the people are crowding around you and pressing against you!”

<p>
<verse sID="Luke.8.46" osisID="Luke.8.46" n="46" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Somebody touched me,”</q>  said Jesus, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“for I felt that power had gone out from me.”</q>

<verse eID="Luke.8.49" />
<verse sID="Luke.8.50" osisID="Luke.8.50" n="50" />But Jesus, hearing this, spoke to the leader, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Do not be afraid; only have faith, and she will yet be delivered.”</q>
<verse eID="Luke.8.50" />
<verse sID="Luke.8.51" osisID="Luke.8.51" n="51" />When he reached the house, he did not allow anyone to go in with him, except Peter, John, and James, and the child’s father and mother.
<verse eID="Luke.8.51" />
<verse sID="Luke.8.52" osisID="Luke.8.52" n="52" />And everyone was weeping and mourning for her.
</p>
<p>
<q who="Jesus" marker="">“Do not weep,”</q>  Jesus said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“she is not dead; she is asleep.”</q>
<verse eID="Luke.8.52" />
<verse sID="Luke.8.53" osisID="Luke.8.53" n="53" />They began to laugh at him, for they knew that she was dead.
<verse eID="Luke.8.53" />
<verse sID="Luke.8.54" osisID="Luke.8.54" n="54" />But, taking her by the hand, Jesus said in a loud voice, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Child, rise!”</q>
<verse eID="Luke.8.54" />
<verse sID="Luke.8.55" osisID="Luke.8.55" n="55" />The child’s spirit returned to her, and she instantly stood up; and Jesus ordered them to give her something to eat.
<verse eID="Luke.8.55" />
<verse sID="Luke.8.56" osisID="Luke.8.56" n="56" />Her parents were amazed, but Jesus impressed on them that they were not to tell anyone what had happened.

<verse eID="Luke.9.1" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.2" osisID="Luke.9.2" n="2" />He sent them out as his messengers, to proclaim the kingdom of God, and to work cures.

<verse sID="Luke.9.3" osisID="Luke.9.3" n="3" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Do not,”</q>  he said to them, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“take anything for your journey; not even a staff, or a bag, or bread, or any silver, or a change of clothes with you.</q>

<verse eID="Luke.9.6" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.9.7" osisID="Luke.9.7" n="7" />Prince Herod heard of all that was happening, and was perplexed, because it was said by some that John must be risen from the dead.
<verse eID="Luke.9.7" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.8" osisID="Luke.9.8" n="8" />Some again said that Elijah had appeared, and others that one of the old prophets had risen again.
<verse eID="Luke.9.8" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.9" osisID="Luke.9.9" n="9" />But Herod himself said, “John I beheaded; but who is this of whom I hear such things?” And he endeavored to see him.

</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.9.10" osisID="Luke.9.10" n="10" />When the apostles returned, they related to Jesus all that they had done. Then Jesus went privately to a town called Bethsaida, taking the apostles with him.
<verse eID="Luke.9.10" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.11" osisID="Luke.9.11" n="11" />But the people recognized him and followed him in crowds; and Jesus welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, while he cured those who were in need of help.
<verse eID="Luke.9.11" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.12" osisID="Luke.9.12" n="12" />The day was drawing to a close, when the twelve came up to him, and said, “Send the crowd away, so that they may make their way to the villages and farms around about, and find themselves lodgings and provisions, for we are in a lonely spot here.”
<verse eID="Luke.9.12" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.13" osisID="Luke.9.13" n="13" />But Jesus said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“It is for you to give them something to eat.”</q>
</p>
<p>
“We have not more than five loaves and two fish,” they answered. “Unless indeed we are to go and buy food for all these people.”

<verse sID="Luke.9.14" osisID="Luke.9.14" n="14" />(For the men among them were about five thousand.) <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Get them seated in companies,”</q>  was his reply, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“about fifty in each.”</q>
<verse eID="Luke.9.14" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.15" osisID="Luke.9.15" n="15" />This they did, and got all the people seated.
<verse eID="Luke.9.15" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.16" osisID="Luke.9.16" n="16" />Taking the five loaves and the two fish, Jesus looked up to heaven and said the blessing over them. Then he broke them in pieces, and gave them to his disciples to set before the people.
<verse eID="Luke.9.16" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.17" osisID="Luke.9.17" n="17" />Everyone had sufficient to eat, and what was left of the broken pieces was picked up – twelve baskets.
<verse eID="Luke.9.17" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.9.18" osisID="Luke.9.18" n="18" />Afterward, when Jesus was alone, praying, his disciples joined him, and he asked them this question – <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Who do the people say that I am?”</q>
<verse eID="Luke.9.18" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.9.19" osisID="Luke.9.19" n="19" />“John the Baptist,” was their answer. “Others, however, say that you are Elijah, while others say that one of the old prophets has risen again.”

<verse eID="Luke.9.20" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.9.21" osisID="Luke.9.21" n="21" />Jesus, however, strictly charged them not to say this to anyone;
<verse eID="Luke.9.21" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.22" osisID="Luke.9.22" n="22" />he told them that the Son of Man must undergo much suffering, and be rejected by the elders, and chief priests, and teachers of the Law, and be put to death, and rise on the third day.

<verse sID="Luke.9.23" osisID="Luke.9.23" n="23" />And to all present he said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“If any one wishes to walk in my steps, they must renounce self, and take up their cross daily, and follow me.</q>

<lb type="x-p" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.28" osisID="Luke.9.28" n="28" />About eight days after speaking these words, Jesus went up the mountain to pray, taking with him Peter, John, and James.
<verse eID="Luke.9.28" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.29" osisID="Luke.9.29" n="29" />As he was praying, the aspect of his face was changed, and his clothing became of a glittering whiteness.
<verse eID="Luke.9.29" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.30" osisID="Luke.9.30" n="30" />And all at once two men were talking with Jesus; they were Moses and Elijah,
<verse eID="Luke.9.30" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.31" osisID="Luke.9.31" n="31" />who appeared in a glorified state, and spoke of his departure, which was destined to take place at Jerusalem.
<verse eID="Luke.9.31" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.32" osisID="Luke.9.32" n="32" />Peter and his companions had been overpowered by sleep but, suddenly becoming wide awake, they saw Jesus glorified and the two men who were standing beside him.
<verse eID="Luke.9.32" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.9.33" osisID="Luke.9.33" n="33" />And, as Moses and Elijah were passing away from Jesus, Peter exclaimed, “Sir, it is good to be here; let us make three tents, one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” He did not know what he was saying;
<verse eID="Luke.9.33" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.34" osisID="Luke.9.34" n="34" />and, while he was speaking, a cloud came down and enveloped them; and they were afraid, as they passed into the cloud;
<verse eID="Luke.9.34" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.35" osisID="Luke.9.35" n="35" />and from the cloud came a voice which said – “This is my Son, the Chosen One; him you must hear.”
<verse eID="Luke.9.35" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.36" osisID="Luke.9.36" n="36" />And, as the voice ceased, Jesus was found alone. The apostles kept silence, and told no one about any of the things that they had seen.
<verse eID="Luke.9.36" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.9.37" osisID="Luke.9.37" n="37" />The next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a great crowd met Jesus.
<verse eID="Luke.9.37" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.38" osisID="Luke.9.38" n="38" />And just then a man in the crowd shouted out, “Teacher, I entreat you to look at my son, for he is my only child;

<verse sID="Luke.9.39" osisID="Luke.9.39" n="39" />all at once a spirit will seize him, suddenly shriek out, and throw him into convulsions until he foams, and will leave him only when he is utterly exhausted.

<verse sID="Luke.9.40" osisID="Luke.9.40" n="40" />I entreated your disciples to drive the spirit out, but they could not.”

<verse eID="Luke.9.41" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.42" osisID="Luke.9.42" n="42" />While the boy was coming up to Jesus, the demon dashed him down and threw him into convulsions. But Jesus rebuked the foul spirit, and cured the boy, and gave him back to his father.
<verse eID="Luke.9.42" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.43" osisID="Luke.9.43" n="43" />And all present were struck with awe at the majesty of God.
</p>
<p>
In the midst of the general astonishment at all that Jesus was doing, he said to his disciples,
<verse eID="Luke.9.43" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.44" osisID="Luke.9.44" n="44" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Listen carefully to my words. For the Son of Man is destined to be betrayed into the hands of his fellow men.”</q>
<verse eID="Luke.9.44" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.45" osisID="Luke.9.45" n="45" />But the disciples did not understand the meaning of this; it had been concealed from them so that they did not see it, and they were afraid to question him as to what he meant.
<verse eID="Luke.9.45" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.9.46" osisID="Luke.9.46" n="46" />A discussion arose among the disciples as to which of them was the greatest;
<verse eID="Luke.9.46" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.47" osisID="Luke.9.47" n="47" />and Jesus, knowing of the discussion that was occupying their thoughts, took hold of a little child, and placed it beside him,
<verse eID="Luke.9.47" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.48" osisID="Luke.9.48" n="48" />and then said to them, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Anyone who, for the sake of my name, welcomes even this little child is welcoming me; and anyone who welcomes me is welcoming him who sent me as his messenger. For whoever is least among you all – that person is great.”</q>
<verse eID="Luke.9.48" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.9.49" osisID="Luke.9.49" n="49" />John said, “Sir, we saw a man driving out demons by using your name, and we tried to prevent him, because he does not follow you with us.”

<verse sID="Luke.19.3" osisID="Luke.19.3" n="3" />He tried to see what Jesus was like; but, being short, he was unable to do so because of the crowd.
<verse eID="Luke.19.3" />
<verse sID="Luke.19.4" osisID="Luke.19.4" n="4" />So he ran on ahead and climbed into a mulberry tree, to see Jesus, for he knew that he must pass that way.
<verse eID="Luke.19.4" />
<verse sID="Luke.19.5" osisID="Luke.19.5" n="5" />When Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Zacchaeus, be quick and come down, for I must stop at your house today.”</q>

<verse sID="Luke.19.7" osisID="Luke.19.7" n="7" />On seeing this, everyone began to complain, “He has gone to stay with a man who is an outcast.”
<verse eID="Luke.19.7" />
<verse sID="Luke.19.8" osisID="Luke.19.8" n="8" />But Zacchaeus stood forward and said to the Master, “Listen, Master! I will give half my property to the poor, and, if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I will give him back four times as much.”

<chapter sID="Luke.22" osisID="Luke.22" n="22" />
<verse sID="Luke.22.1" osisID="Luke.22.1" n="1" />The feast of the unleavened bread, known as the Passover, was near.
<verse eID="Luke.22.1" />
<verse sID="Luke.22.2" osisID="Luke.22.2" n="2" />The chief priest and the teachers of the Law were looking for an opportunity of destroying Jesus, for they were afraid of the people.
<verse eID="Luke.22.2" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.22.3" osisID="Luke.22.3" n="3" />Now Satan took possession of Judas, who was known as Iscariot, and who belonged to the Twelve;
<verse eID="Luke.22.3" />
<verse sID="Luke.22.4" osisID="Luke.22.4" n="4" />and he went and discussed with the chief priests and officers in charge at the Temple the best way of betraying Jesus to them.
<verse eID="Luke.22.4" />
<verse sID="Luke.22.5" osisID="Luke.22.5" n="5" />They were glad of this, and agreed to pay him.
<verse eID="Luke.22.5" />
<verse sID="Luke.22.6" osisID="Luke.22.6" n="6" />So Judas assented, and looked for an opportunity to betray Jesus to them, in the absence of a crowd.
<verse eID="Luke.22.6" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.22.7" osisID="Luke.22.7" n="7" />When the day of the Festival of the unleavened bread came, on which the Passover lambs had to be killed,

<p>
<verse sID="Luke.22.9" osisID="Luke.22.9" n="9" />“Where do you wish us to make preparations?” they asked.

<verse sID="Luke.22.61" osisID="Luke.22.61" n="61" />And the Master turned and looked at Peter; and Peter remembered the words that the Master had said to him – <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Before a cock has crowed today, you will disown me three times”;</q>
<verse eID="Luke.22.61" />
<verse sID="Luke.22.62" osisID="Luke.22.62" n="62" />and he went outside and wept bitterly.
<verse eID="Luke.22.62" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.22.63" osisID="Luke.22.63" n="63" />The men who held Jesus kept making sport of him and beating him.
<verse eID="Luke.22.63" />
<verse sID="Luke.22.64" osisID="Luke.22.64" n="64" />They blindfolded him and then questioned him. “Now play the prophet,” they said. “Who was it that struck you?”
<verse eID="Luke.22.64" />
<verse sID="Luke.22.65" osisID="Luke.22.65" n="65" />And they heaped many other insults on him.
<verse eID="Luke.22.65" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.22.66" osisID="Luke.22.66" n="66" />At daybreak the assembly of the elders of the people met – both the chief priests and the teachers of the Law – and took Jesus before their High Council.
<verse eID="Luke.22.66" />
<verse sID="Luke.22.67" osisID="Luke.22.67" n="67" />“If you are the Christ,” they said, “tell us so.”
</p>
<p>
<q who="Jesus" marker="">“If I tell you,”</q>  replied Jesus, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“you will not believe me;</q>

<p>
<verse sID="Luke.22.70" osisID="Luke.22.70" n="70" />“Are you, then, the Son of God?” they all asked. <q who="Jesus" marker="">“It is true,”</q>  answered Jesus, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“I am.”</q>
<verse eID="Luke.22.70" />
<verse sID="Luke.22.71" osisID="Luke.22.71" n="71" />At this they exclaimed, “Why do we want any more evidence? We have heard it ourselves from his own lips!”
<verse eID="Luke.22.71" />
<chapter eID="Luke.22" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Luke.23" osisID="Luke.23" n="23" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.1" osisID="Luke.23.1" n="1" />Then they all rose in a body and led Jesus before Pilate.
<verse eID="Luke.23.1" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.2" osisID="Luke.23.2" n="2" />And they began to accuse him, “This is a man whom we found misleading our people, preventing them from paying taxes to the Emperor, and giving out that he himself is ‘Christ, a king.’”
<verse eID="Luke.23.2" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.23.3" osisID="Luke.23.3" n="3" />“Are you the king of the Jews?” Pilate asked him. <q who="Jesus" marker="">“It is true,”</q>  replied Jesus.
<verse eID="Luke.23.3" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.4" osisID="Luke.23.4" n="4" />But Pilate, turning to the chief priests and the people, said, “I do not see anything to find fault with in this man.”
<verse eID="Luke.23.4" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.5" osisID="Luke.23.5" n="5" />But they insisted, “He is stirring up the people by his teaching all through Judea; he began with Galilee and has now come here.”
<verse eID="Luke.23.5" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.6" osisID="Luke.23.6" n="6" />Hearing this, Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean;
<verse eID="Luke.23.6" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.7" osisID="Luke.23.7" n="7" />and, having satisfied himself that Jesus came under Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who also was at Jerusalem at the time.
<verse eID="Luke.23.7" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.8" osisID="Luke.23.8" n="8" />When Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly pleased, for he had been wanting to see him for a long time, having heard a great deal about him; and he was hoping to see some sign given by him.
<verse eID="Luke.23.8" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.9" osisID="Luke.23.9" n="9" />So he questioned him at some length, but Jesus made no reply.
<verse eID="Luke.23.9" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.10" osisID="Luke.23.10" n="10" />Meanwhile the chief priests and the teachers of the Law stood by and vehemently accused him.
<verse eID="Luke.23.10" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.11" osisID="Luke.23.11" n="11" />And Herod, with his soldiers, treated Jesus with scorn; he mocked him by throwing a gorgeous robe around him, and then sent him back to Pilate.
<verse eID="Luke.23.11" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.12" osisID="Luke.23.12" n="12" />And Herod and Pilate became friends that very day, for before that there had been ill-will between them.
<verse eID="Luke.23.12" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.23.13" osisID="Luke.23.13" n="13" />So Pilate summoned the chief priests, and the leading men, and the people,
<verse eID="Luke.23.13" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.14" osisID="Luke.23.14" n="14" />and said to them, “You brought this man before me charged with misleading the people; and yet, for my part, though I examined him before you, I did not find this man to blame for any of the things of which you accuse him;
<verse eID="Luke.23.14" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.15" osisID="Luke.23.15" n="15" />nor did Herod either; for he has sent him back to us. And, as a fact, he has not done anything deserving death;
<verse eID="Luke.23.15" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.16" osisID="Luke.23.16" n="16" />so I will have him scourged, and then release him.”

<verse eID="Luke.23.17" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.18" osisID="Luke.23.18" n="18" />But they began to shout as one man, “Kill this fellow, but release Barabbas for us.”
<verse eID="Luke.23.18" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.19" osisID="Luke.23.19" n="19" />(Barabbas was a man who had been put in prison for a riot that had broken out in the city and for murder.)
<verse eID="Luke.23.19" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.20" osisID="Luke.23.20" n="20" />Pilate, however, wanting to release Jesus, called to them again;
<verse eID="Luke.23.20" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.21" osisID="Luke.23.21" n="21" />but they kept calling out, “Crucify, crucify him!”
<verse eID="Luke.23.21" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.23.22" osisID="Luke.23.22" n="22" />“Why, what harm has this man done?” Pilate said to them for the third time. “I have found nothing in him for which he could be condemned to death. So I will have him scourged, and then release him.”
<verse eID="Luke.23.22" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.23" osisID="Luke.23.23" n="23" />But they persisted in loudly demanding his crucifixion; and their clamor gained the day.
<verse eID="Luke.23.23" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.24" osisID="Luke.23.24" n="24" />Pilate decided that their demand should be granted.
<verse eID="Luke.23.24" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.25" osisID="Luke.23.25" n="25" />He released the man who had been put in prison for riot and murder, as they demanded, and gave Jesus up to be dealt with as they pleased.
<verse eID="Luke.23.25" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.23.26" osisID="Luke.23.26" n="26" />And, as they were leading Jesus away, they laid hold of Simon from Cyrene, who was on his way in from the country, and they put the cross on his shoulders, for him to carry it behind Jesus.
<verse eID="Luke.23.26" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.27" osisID="Luke.23.27" n="27" />There was a great crowd of people following him, many being women who were beating their breasts and wailing for him.
<verse eID="Luke.23.27" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.28" osisID="Luke.23.28" n="28" />So Jesus turned and said to them, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Women of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.</q>

<verse sID="Luke.23.32" osisID="Luke.23.32" n="32" />There were two others also, criminals, led out to be executed with Jesus.
<verse eID="Luke.23.32" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.33" osisID="Luke.23.33" n="33" />When they had reached the place called ‘The Skull,’ there they crucified Jesus and the criminals, one on the right, and one on the left.
<verse eID="Luke.23.33" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.34" osisID="Luke.23.34" n="34" />Then Jesus said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Father, forgive them; they do not know what they are doing.”</q>  His clothes they divided among them by casting lots.
<verse eID="Luke.23.34" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.35" osisID="Luke.23.35" n="35" />Meanwhile the people stood looking on. Even the leading men said with a sneer, “He saved others, let him save himself, if he is God’s Christ, his chosen one.”
<verse eID="Luke.23.35" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.36" osisID="Luke.23.36" n="36" />The soldiers, too, came up in mockery, bringing him common wine,

<verse eID="Luke.23.39" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.40" osisID="Luke.23.40" n="40" />But the other rebuked him. “Haven’t you,” he said, “any fear of God, now that you are under the same sentence?

<p>
<verse sID="Luke.23.44" osisID="Luke.23.44" n="44" />It was nearly midday, when a darkness came over the whole country, lasting until three in the afternoon,

<verse eID="Luke.23.45" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.46" osisID="Luke.23.46" n="46" />Then Jesus, with a loud cry, said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Father, into your hands I commit my spirit.”</q>  And with these words he expired.
<verse eID="Luke.23.46" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.47" osisID="Luke.23.47" n="47" />The Roman captain, on seeing what had happened, praised God, exclaiming, “This must have been a good man!”

<p>
<verse sID="Luke.23.50" osisID="Luke.23.50" n="50" />Now there was a man of the name of Joseph, who was a member of the Council, and who bore a good and upright character.

<verse sID="Luke.23.53" osisID="Luke.23.53" n="53" />and, when he had taken it down, he wrapped it in a linen sheet, and laid him in a tomb cut out of stone, in which no one had yet been buried.

<verse sID="Luke.24.2" osisID="Luke.24.2" n="2" />They found that the stone had been rolled away from the tomb;

<verse eID="Luke.24.3" />
<verse sID="Luke.24.4" osisID="Luke.24.4" n="4" />While they were at a loss to account for this, all at once two men stood beside them, in dazzling clothing.
<verse eID="Luke.24.4" />
<verse sID="Luke.24.5" osisID="Luke.24.5" n="5" />But, when in their fear the women bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, “Why are you looking among the dead for him who is living?

</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.24.13" osisID="Luke.24.13" n="13" />It happened that very day that two of the disciples were going to a village called Emmaus, which was about seven miles from Jerusalem,
<verse eID="Luke.24.13" />
<verse sID="Luke.24.14" osisID="Luke.24.14" n="14" />talking together, as they went, about all that had just taken place.

<p>
<verse sID="Luke.24.19" osisID="Luke.24.19" n="19" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“What things do you mean?”</q>  asked Jesus. “Why, about Jesus of Nazareth,” they answered, “who, in the eyes of God and all the people, was a prophet, whose power was felt in both his words and actions;

<verse sID="Luke.24.20" osisID="Luke.24.20" n="20" />and how the chief priests and our leading men gave him up to be sentenced to death, and afterward crucified him.
<verse eID="Luke.24.20" />
<verse sID="Luke.24.21" osisID="Luke.24.21" n="21" />But we were hoping that he was the Destined Deliverer of Israel; yes, and besides all this, it is now three days since these things occurred.
<verse eID="Luke.24.21" />
<verse sID="Luke.24.22" osisID="Luke.24.22" n="22" />And what is more, some of the women among us have greatly astonished us. They went to the tomb at daybreak
<verse eID="Luke.24.22" />
<verse sID="Luke.24.23" osisID="Luke.24.23" n="23" />And, not finding the body of Jesus there, came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels who told them that he was alive.

<verse sID="Luke.24.29" osisID="Luke.24.29" n="29" />but they pressed him not to do so. “Stay with us,” they said, “for it is getting towards evening, and the sun in already low.” So Jesus went in to stay with them.

<verse eID="Luke.24.36" />
<verse sID="Luke.24.37" osisID="Luke.24.37" n="37" />In their terror and alarm they thought they saw a ghost,
<verse eID="Luke.24.37" />
<verse sID="Luke.24.38" osisID="Luke.24.38" n="38" />but Jesus said to them, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Why are you so startled? And why do doubts arise in your minds?</q>

<verse sID="Luke.24.39" osisID="Luke.24.39" n="39" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">Look at my hands and my feet, and you will know that it is I. Feel me, and look at me, for a ghost has not flesh and bones, as you see that I have.”</q>

<verse sID="Luke.24.41" osisID="Luke.24.41" n="41" />While they were still unable to believe it all, overcome with joy, and were wondering if it were true, Jesus said to them, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Have you anything here to eat?”</q>
<verse eID="Luke.24.41" />
<verse sID="Luke.24.42" osisID="Luke.24.42" n="42" />They handed him a piece of broiled fish,
<verse eID="Luke.24.42" />
<verse sID="Luke.24.43" osisID="Luke.24.43" n="43" />and he took it and ate it before their eyes.

<verse eID="Luke.24.44" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.24.45" osisID="Luke.24.45" n="45" />Then he enabled them to understand the meaning of the scriptures, saying to them,
<verse eID="Luke.24.45" />
<verse sID="Luke.24.46" osisID="Luke.24.46" n="46" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Scripture says that the Christ will suffer, and that he will rise again from the dead on the third day,</q>

</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Luke.24.50" osisID="Luke.24.50" n="50" />After this, Jesus led them out as far as Bethany, and there raised his hands and blessed them.

<!-- s --><title>The Preparation</title>
<p>
<verse sID="John.1.19" osisID="John.1.19" n="19" />When the religious authorities in Jerusalem sent some Priests and Levites to ask John – “Who are you?”,
<verse eID="John.1.19" />
<verse sID="John.1.20" osisID="John.1.20" n="20" />he told them clearly and simply, “I am not the Christ.”
<verse eID="John.1.20" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.1.21" osisID="John.1.21" n="21" />“What then?” they asked. “Are you Elijah?”
</p>
<p>
“No,” he said, “I am not.”
</p>
<p>
“Are you ‘the prophet’?” He answered, “No.”
<verse eID="John.1.21" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.1.22" osisID="John.1.22" n="22" />“Who then are you?” they continued. “Tell us so that we have an answer to give to those who have sent us. What do you say about yourself?”
<verse eID="John.1.22" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.1.23" osisID="John.1.23" n="23" />“I,” he answered, “am –

<lg>
<l level="1">‘The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness: make a straight road for the Lord’, </l>
</lg>
<lb type="x-p" />
<p type="x-noindent">
as the prophet Isaiah said.”
<verse eID="John.1.23" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.1.24" osisID="John.1.24" n="24" />These men had been sent from the Pharisees;
<verse eID="John.1.24" />
<verse sID="John.1.25" osisID="John.1.25" n="25" />and their next question was, “Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ or Elijah or ‘the prophet’?”
<verse eID="John.1.25" />
<verse sID="John.1.26" osisID="John.1.26" n="26" />John’s answer was – “I baptize with water, but among you stands one whom you do not know;
<verse eID="John.1.26" />
<verse sID="John.1.27" osisID="John.1.27" n="27" />he is coming after me, yet I am not worthy even to unfasten his sandal.”
<verse eID="John.1.27" />
<verse sID="John.1.28" osisID="John.1.28" n="28" />This happened at Bethany, across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
<verse eID="John.1.28" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.1.29" osisID="John.1.29" n="29" />The next day John saw Jesus coming towards him, and exclaimed, “Here is the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!
<verse eID="John.1.29" />
<verse sID="John.1.30" osisID="John.1.30" n="30" />I was talking about him when I said ‘After me there is coming a man who ranks ahead of me, because before I was born he already was.’
<verse eID="John.1.30" />
<verse sID="John.1.31" osisID="John.1.31" n="31" />I did not know who he was, but I have come baptizing with water to make him known to Israel.”
<verse eID="John.1.31" />
<verse sID="John.1.32" osisID="John.1.32" n="32" />John also said:
</p>
<p>
“I saw the Spirit come down from heaven like a dove and rest on him.
<verse eID="John.1.32" />
<verse sID="John.1.33" osisID="John.1.33" n="33" />I myself did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water, he said to me ‘He on whom you see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him – he it is who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’
<verse eID="John.1.33" />
<verse sID="John.1.34" osisID="John.1.34" n="34" />This I have seen myself, and I have declared my belief that he is the Son of God.”
<verse eID="John.1.34" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.1.35" osisID="John.1.35" n="35" />The next day, when John was standing with two of his disciples,
<verse eID="John.1.35" />
<verse sID="John.1.36" osisID="John.1.36" n="36" />he looked at Jesus as he passed and exclaimed, “There is the Lamb of God!”
<verse eID="John.1.36" />
<verse sID="John.1.37" osisID="John.1.37" n="37" />The two disciples heard him say this, and followed Jesus.
<verse eID="John.1.37" />
<verse sID="John.1.38" osisID="John.1.38" n="38" />But Jesus turned around, and saw them following. <q who="Jesus" marker="">“What are you looking for?”</q>  he asked. “Rabbi,” they answered (or, as we should say, ‘Teacher’), “where are you staying?”
<verse eID="John.1.38" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.1.39" osisID="John.1.39" n="39" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Come, and you will see,”</q>  he replied. So they went, and saw where he was staying, and spent that day with him.
</p>
<p>
It was then about four in the afternoon.
<verse eID="John.1.39" />
<verse sID="John.1.40" osisID="John.1.40" n="40" />One of the two, who heard what John said and followed Jesus, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.
<verse eID="John.1.40" />
<verse sID="John.1.41" osisID="John.1.41" n="41" />He first found his own brother Simon, and said to him, “We have found the Messiah!” (a word which means ‘Christ,’ or ‘Consecrated’.)
<verse eID="John.1.41" />
<verse sID="John.1.42" osisID="John.1.42" n="42" />Then he brought him to Jesus. Looking straight at him, Jesus said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“You are Simon, the son of John; you will be called Cephas”</q>  (which means ‘Peter,’ or ‘Rock’).
<verse eID="John.1.42" />
<verse sID="John.1.43" osisID="John.1.43" n="43" />The following day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. He found Philip, and said to him, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Follow me.”</q>
<verse eID="John.1.43" />
<verse sID="John.1.44" osisID="John.1.44" n="44" />Philip was from Bethsaida, the same town as Andrew and Peter.
<verse eID="John.1.44" />
<verse sID="John.1.45" osisID="John.1.45" n="45" />He found Nathanael and said to him, “We have found him of whom Moses wrote in the Law, and of whom the prophets also wrote – Jesus of Nazareth, Joseph’s son!”
<verse eID="John.1.45" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.1.46" osisID="John.1.46" n="46" />“Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” asked Nathanael. “Come and see,” replied Philip.
<verse eID="John.1.46" />
<verse sID="John.1.47" osisID="John.1.47" n="47" />When Jesus saw Nathanael coming towards him, he said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Here is a true Israelite, in whom there is no deceit!”</q>
<verse eID="John.1.47" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.1.48" osisID="John.1.48" n="48" />“How do you know me?” asked Nathanael. <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Even before Philip called you,”</q>  replied Jesus, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.”</q>
<verse eID="John.1.48" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.1.49" osisID="John.1.49" n="49" />“Rabbi,” Nathanael exclaimed, “you are the Son of God, you are king of Israel!”
<verse eID="John.1.49" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.1.50" osisID="John.1.50" n="50" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Do you believe in me,”</q>  asked Jesus, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than those!</q>
<verse eID="John.1.50" />
<verse sID="John.1.51" osisID="John.1.51" n="51" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">In truth I tell you,”</q>  he added, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“you will all see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”</q>

<!-- s --><title>The Work in Judaea, Galilee and Samaria</title>
<p>
<verse sID="John.2.1" osisID="John.2.1" n="1" />Two days after this there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee, and Jesus’ mother was there.
<verse eID="John.2.1" />
<verse sID="John.2.2" osisID="John.2.2" n="2" />Jesus himself, too, with his disciples, was invited to the wedding.
<verse eID="John.2.2" />
<verse sID="John.2.3" osisID="John.2.3" n="3" />And, when the wine ran short, his mother said to him, “They have no wine left.”
<verse eID="John.2.3" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.2.4" osisID="John.2.4" n="4" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“What do you want with me?”</q>  answered Jesus. <q who="Jesus" marker="">“My time has not come yet.”</q>
<verse eID="John.2.4" />
<verse sID="John.2.5" osisID="John.2.5" n="5" />His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever he tells you.”
<verse eID="John.2.5" />
<verse sID="John.2.6" osisID="John.2.6" n="6" />There were standing there six stone water-jars, in accordance with the Jewish rule of purification, each holding twenty or thirty gallons.
<verse eID="John.2.6" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.2.7" osisID="John.2.7" n="7" />Jesus said to the servants, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Fill the water-jars with water.”</q>
<verse eID="John.2.7" />
<verse sID="John.2.8" osisID="John.2.8" n="8" />And, when they had filled them to the brim, he added, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Now take some out, and carry it to the Master of the feast.”</q>  The servants did so.
<verse eID="John.2.8" />
<verse sID="John.2.9" osisID="John.2.9" n="9" />And, when the Master of the feast had tasted the water which had now become wine, not knowing where it had come from – although the servants who had taken out the water knew –
<verse eID="John.2.9" />
<verse sID="John.2.10" osisID="John.2.10" n="10" />He called the groom and said to him, “Everyone puts good wine on the table first, and inferior wine afterward, when his guests have drunk freely; but you have kept back the good wine till now!”
<verse eID="John.2.10" />
<verse sID="John.2.11" osisID="John.2.11" n="11" />This, the first sign of his mission, Jesus gave at Cana in Galilee, and by it revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him.
<verse eID="John.2.11" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.2.12" osisID="John.2.12" n="12" />After this, Jesus went down to Capernaum – he, his mother, his brothers, and his disciples; but they stayed there only a few days.
<verse eID="John.2.12" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.2.13" osisID="John.2.13" n="13" />Then, as the Jewish Passover was near, Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
<verse eID="John.2.13" />
<verse sID="John.2.14" osisID="John.2.14" n="14" />In the Temple Courts he found people who were selling bullocks, sheep, and pigeons, and the money changers at their counters.
<verse eID="John.2.14" />
<verse sID="John.2.15" osisID="John.2.15" n="15" />So he made a whip of cords, and drove them all out of the Temple Courts, and the sheep and bullocks as well; he scattered the money of the money changers, and overturned their tables,
<verse eID="John.2.15" />
<verse sID="John.2.16" osisID="John.2.16" n="16" />and said to the pigeon-dealers, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Take these things away. Do not turn my Father’s house into a market house.”</q>
<verse eID="John.2.16" />
<verse sID="John.2.17" osisID="John.2.17" n="17" />His disciples remembered that scripture said – ‘Passion for your house will consume me.’
<verse eID="John.2.17" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.2.18" osisID="John.2.18" n="18" />Then some of the religious authorities asked Jesus, “What sign are you going to show us, since you act in this way?”
<verse eID="John.2.18" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.2.19" osisID="John.2.19" n="19" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Destroy this temple,”</q>  was his answer, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“and I will raise it in three days.”</q>
<verse eID="John.2.19" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.2.20" osisID="John.2.20" n="20" />“This Temple,” the authorities replied, “has been forty-six years in building, and are you going to ‘raise it in three days’?”
<verse eID="John.2.20" />
<verse sID="John.2.21" osisID="John.2.21" n="21" />But Jesus was speaking of his body as a temple.
<verse eID="John.2.21" />
<verse sID="John.2.22" osisID="John.2.22" n="22" />Afterward, when he had risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this; and they believed the passage of scripture, and the words which Jesus had spoken.
<verse eID="John.2.22" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.2.23" osisID="John.2.23" n="23" />While Jesus was in Jerusalem, during the Passover Festival, many came to trust in him, when they saw the signs of his mission that he was giving.
<verse eID="John.2.23" />
<verse sID="John.2.24" osisID="John.2.24" n="24" />But Jesus did not put himself in their power because he knew what was in their hearts.
<verse eID="John.2.24" />
<verse sID="John.2.25" osisID="John.2.25" n="25" />He did not need anyone to tell him about people because he could read what was in them.

<p>
<chapter sID="John.3" osisID="John.3" n="3" />

<verse sID="John.3.2" osisID="John.3.2" n="2" />This man came to Jesus by night, and said to him, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God; for no one could give such signs as you are giving, unless God were with him.”

<verse eID="John.3.22" />
<verse sID="John.3.23" osisID="John.3.23" n="23" />John, also, was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there were many streams there; and people were constantly coming and being baptized.

<verse eID="John.3.26" />
<verse sID="John.3.27" osisID="John.3.27" n="27" />John’s answer was – “A person can gain nothing but what is given them from heaven.

<verse sID="John.4.6" osisID="John.4.6" n="6" />Jacob’s Spring was there, and Jesus, being tired after his journey, sat down beside the spring, just as he was. It was then about midday.

<verse eID="John.4.27" />
<verse sID="John.4.28" osisID="John.4.28" n="28" />So the woman, leaving her pitcher, went back to the town, and said to the people,

<p>
<verse sID="John.4.39" osisID="John.4.39" n="39" />Many from that town came to believe in Jesus – Samaritans though they were – because the woman had said, ‘He has told me everything that I have done.’
<verse eID="John.4.39" />
<verse sID="John.4.40" osisID="John.4.40" n="40" />And, when these Samaritans had come to Jesus, they begged him to stay with them, and he stayed there two days.
<verse eID="John.4.40" />
<verse sID="John.4.41" osisID="John.4.41" n="41" />But far more came to believe in him because of what he said himself,

<verse eID="John.4.42" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.4.43" osisID="John.4.43" n="43" />After these two days Jesus went on to Galilee;
<verse eID="John.4.43" />
<verse sID="John.4.44" osisID="John.4.44" n="44" />for he himself declared that ‘a prophet is not honored in his own country.’
<verse eID="John.4.44" />
<verse sID="John.4.45" osisID="John.4.45" n="45" />When he entered Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, for they had seen all that he did at Jerusalem during the Festival, at which they also had been present.
<verse eID="John.4.45" />
<verse sID="John.4.46" osisID="John.4.46" n="46" />So Jesus came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. Now there was one of the king’s officers whose son was lying ill at Capernaum.
<verse eID="John.4.46" />
<verse sID="John.4.47" osisID="John.4.47" n="47" />When this man heard that Jesus had returned from Judea to Galilee, he went to him, and begged him to come down and cure his son; for he was at the point of death.
<verse eID="John.4.47" />
<verse sID="John.4.48" osisID="John.4.48" n="48" />Jesus answered, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Unless you all see signs and wonders, you will not believe.”</q>

<verse sID="John.4.51" osisID="John.4.51" n="51" />and, while he was on his way down, his servants met him, and told him that his child was living.
<verse eID="John.4.51" />
<verse sID="John.4.52" osisID="John.4.52" n="52" />So he asked them at what time the boy began to get better. “It was yesterday, about one o’clock,” they said, “that the fever left him.”
<verse eID="John.4.52" />
<verse sID="John.4.53" osisID="John.4.53" n="53" />By this the father knew that it was at the very time when Jesus had said to him <q who="Jesus" marker="">‘Your son is living’</q> ; and he himself, with all his household, believed in Jesus.
<verse eID="John.4.53" />
<verse sID="John.4.54" osisID="John.4.54" n="54" />This was the second occasion on which Jesus gave a sign of his mission on coming from Judea to Galilee.

<verse sID="John.5.14" osisID="John.5.14" n="14" />Afterward Jesus found the man in the Temple Courts, and said to him, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“You are cured now; do not sin again, or something worse may happen to you.”</q>
<verse eID="John.5.14" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.5.15" osisID="John.5.15" n="15" />The man went away, and told the authorities that it was Jesus who had cured him.
<verse eID="John.5.15" />
<verse sID="John.5.16" osisID="John.5.16" n="16" />And that was why they began to persecute Jesus – because he did things of this kind on the Sabbath.
<verse eID="John.5.16" />
<verse sID="John.5.17" osisID="John.5.17" n="17" />But Jesus replied, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“My Father works to this very hour, and I work also.”</q>
<verse eID="John.5.17" />
<verse sID="John.5.18" osisID="John.5.18" n="18" />This made the authorities all the more eager to kill him, because not only was he doing away with the Sabbath, but he actually called God his own Father – putting himself on an equality with God.
<verse eID="John.5.18" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.5.19" osisID="John.5.19" n="19" />So Jesus made this further reply, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“In truth I tell you, the Son can do nothing of himself; he does only what he sees the Father doing; whatever the Father does, the Son does also.</q>

<verse eID="John.6.1" />
<verse sID="John.6.2" osisID="John.6.2" n="2" />A great crowd of people, however, followed him, because they saw the signs of his mission in his work among those who were sick.
<verse eID="John.6.2" />
<verse sID="John.6.3" osisID="John.6.3" n="3" />Jesus went up the hill, and sat down there with his disciples.
<verse eID="John.6.3" />
<verse sID="John.6.4" osisID="John.6.4" n="4" />It was near the time of the Jewish Festival of the Passover.
<verse eID="John.6.4" />
<verse sID="John.6.5" osisID="John.6.5" n="5" />Looking up, and noticing that a great crowd was coming towards him, Jesus said to Philip, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Where are we to buy bread for these people to eat?”</q>
<verse eID="John.6.5" />
<verse sID="John.6.6" osisID="John.6.6" n="6" />He said this to test him, for he himself knew what he meant to do.

<verse eID="John.6.11" />
<verse sID="John.6.12" osisID="John.6.12" n="12" />When they were satisfied, Jesus said to his disciples, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Collect the broken pieces that are left, so that nothing may be wasted.”</q>

</p>
<p>

<verse eID="John.6.21" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.6.22" osisID="John.6.22" n="22" />The people who remained on the further side of the sea had seen that only one boat had been there, and that Jesus had not gone into it with his disciples, but that they had left without him.
<verse eID="John.6.22" />
<verse sID="John.6.23" osisID="John.6.23" n="23" />Some boats, however, had come from Tiberias, from near the spot where they had eaten the bread after the Master had said the thanksgiving.
<verse eID="John.6.23" />
<verse sID="John.6.24" osisID="John.6.24" n="24" />So, on the next day, when the people saw that Jesus was not there, or his disciples either, they themselves got into the boats, and went to Capernaum to look for him.

<verse sID="John.6.25" osisID="John.6.25" n="25" />And, when they found him on the other side of the sea, they said, “When did you get here, Rabbi?”

<verse sID="John.6.67" osisID="John.6.67" n="67" />So Jesus said to the Twelve, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Do you also wish to leave me?”</q>
<verse eID="John.6.67" />
<verse sID="John.6.68" osisID="John.6.68" n="68" />But Simon Peter answered, “Master, to whom would we go? Eternal life is in your teaching;
<verse eID="John.6.68" />
<verse sID="John.6.69" osisID="John.6.69" n="69" />and we have learned to believe and to know that you are the Holy One of God.”
<verse eID="John.6.69" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.6.70" osisID="John.6.70" n="70" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Didn’t I myself choose you to be the Twelve?”</q>  replied Jesus, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“and yet, even of you, one is playing the devil’s part.”</q>
<verse eID="John.6.70" />
<verse sID="John.6.71" osisID="John.6.71" n="71" />He meant Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, who was about to betray him, though he was one of the Twelve.

</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="John.7" osisID="John.7" n="7" />
<verse sID="John.7.1" osisID="John.7.1" n="1" />After this, Jesus went about in Galilee, for he would not do so in Judea, because the religious authorities (in Jerusalem) were eager to put him to death.
<verse eID="John.7.1" />
<verse sID="John.7.2" osisID="John.7.2" n="2" />When the Jewish Festival of Tabernacles was near,
<verse eID="John.7.2" />
<verse sID="John.7.3" osisID="John.7.3" n="3" />his brothers said to him, “Leave this part of the country, and go into Judea, so that your disciples, as well as we, may see the work that you are doing.
<verse eID="John.7.3" />
<verse sID="John.7.4" osisID="John.7.4" n="4" />For no one does a thing privately, if they are seeking to be widely known. Since you do these things, you should show yourself publicly to the world.”
<verse eID="John.7.4" />
<verse sID="John.7.5" osisID="John.7.5" n="5" />For even his brothers did not believe in him.
<verse eID="John.7.5" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.7.6" osisID="John.7.6" n="6" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“My time,”</q>  answered Jesus, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“is not come yet, but your time is always here.</q>
<verse eID="John.7.6" />
<verse sID="John.7.7" osisID="John.7.7" n="7" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">The world cannot hate you, but it does hate me, because I testify that its ways are evil.</q>
<verse eID="John.7.7" />
<verse sID="John.7.8" osisID="John.7.8" n="8" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">Go yourselves up to the Festival; I am not going to this Festival yet, because my time has not yet come.”</q>
<verse eID="John.7.8" />
<verse sID="John.7.9" osisID="John.7.9" n="9" />After telling them this, he stayed on in Galilee.
<verse eID="John.7.9" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.7.10" osisID="John.7.10" n="10" />But, when his brothers had gone up to the Festival, Jesus also went up – not publicly, but privately.
<verse eID="John.7.10" />
<verse sID="John.7.11" osisID="John.7.11" n="11" />The authorities were looking for him at the Festival and asking ‘Where is he?’;
<verse eID="John.7.11" />
<verse sID="John.7.12" osisID="John.7.12" n="12" />and there were many whispers about him among the people, some saying ‘He is a good man;’ others, ‘No! He is leading the people astray.’
<verse eID="John.7.12" />
<verse sID="John.7.13" osisID="John.7.13" n="13" />No one, however, spoke freely about him, because they were afraid of the authorities.
<verse eID="John.7.13" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.7.14" osisID="John.7.14" n="14" />About the middle of the Festival week, Jesus went up into the Temple Courts, and began teaching.
<verse eID="John.7.14" />
<verse sID="John.7.15" osisID="John.7.15" n="15" />The authorities were astonished. “How has this man got his learning,” they asked, “when he has never studied?”
<verse eID="John.7.15" />
<verse sID="John.7.16" osisID="John.7.16" n="16" />So, in reply, Jesus said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“My teaching is not my own; it is his who sent me.</q>
<verse eID="John.7.16" />
<verse sID="John.7.17" osisID="John.7.17" n="17" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">If anyone has the will to do God’s will, they will find out whether my teaching is from God, or whether I speak on my own authority.</q>
<verse eID="John.7.17" />
<verse sID="John.7.18" osisID="John.7.18" n="18" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">The person who speaks on their own authority seeks honor for themselves; but the one who seeks the honor of him who sent him is sincere, and there is nothing false in him.</q>
<verse eID="John.7.18" />
<verse sID="John.7.19" osisID="John.7.19" n="19" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">Was not it Moses who gave you the Law? Yet not one of you obeys it! Why are you seeking to put me to death?”</q>
<verse eID="John.7.19" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.7.20" osisID="John.7.20" n="20" />“You must be possessed by a demon!” the people exclaimed. “Who is seeking to put you to death?”
<verse eID="John.7.20" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.7.21" osisID="John.7.21" n="21" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“There was one thing I did,”</q>  replied Jesus, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“at which you are all still wondering.</q>
<verse eID="John.7.21" />
<verse sID="John.7.22" osisID="John.7.22" n="22" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">But that is why Moses has instituted circumcision among you – not, indeed, that it began with him, but with our ancestors – and that is why you circumcise even on a Sabbath.</q>
<verse eID="John.7.22" />
<verse sID="John.7.23" osisID="John.7.23" n="23" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">When a man receives circumcision on a Sabbath to prevent the Law of Moses from being broken, how can you be angry with me for making a man sound and well on a Sabbath?</q>
<verse eID="John.7.23" />
<verse sID="John.7.24" osisID="John.7.24" n="24" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">Do not judge by appearances; judge justly.”</q>
<verse eID="John.7.24" />
<verse sID="John.7.25" osisID="John.7.25" n="25" />At this some of the people of Jerusalem exclaimed, “Is not this the man who they are seeking to put to death?
<verse eID="John.7.25" />
<verse sID="John.7.26" osisID="John.7.26" n="26" />Yet here he is, speaking out boldly, and they say nothing to him! Is it possible that our leading men have really discovered that he is the Christ?
<verse eID="John.7.26" />
<verse sID="John.7.27" osisID="John.7.27" n="27" />Yet we know where this man is from; but, when the Christ comes, no one will be able to tell where he is from.”
<verse eID="John.7.27" />
<verse sID="John.7.28" osisID="John.7.28" n="28" />Therefore, Jesus, as he was teaching in the Temple Courts, raised his voice and said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Yes; you know me and you know where I am from. Yet I have not come on my own authority, but he who sent me may be trusted; and him you do not know.</q>
<verse eID="John.7.28" />
<verse sID="John.7.29" osisID="John.7.29" n="29" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">I do know him, for it is from him that I have come, and he sent me as his messenger.”</q>
<verse eID="John.7.29" />
<verse sID="John.7.30" osisID="John.7.30" n="30" />So they sought to arrest him; but no one touched him, for his time was not come yet.
<verse eID="John.7.30" />
<verse sID="John.7.31" osisID="John.7.31" n="31" />Many of the people, however, believed in him. “When the Christ comes,” they said, “will he give more signs of his mission than this man has given?”
<verse eID="John.7.31" />
<verse sID="John.7.32" osisID="John.7.32" n="32" />The Pharisees heard the people whispering about him in this way, and so the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him;
<verse eID="John.7.32" />
<verse sID="John.7.33" osisID="John.7.33" n="33" />at which Jesus said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“I will be with you but a little longer, and then I am going to him who sent me.</q>
<verse eID="John.7.33" />
<verse sID="John.7.34" osisID="John.7.34" n="34" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">You will look for me, and you will not find me; and you will not be able to come where I will be.”</q>
<verse eID="John.7.34" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.7.35" osisID="John.7.35" n="35" />“Where is this man going,” the people asked one another, “that we would not find him? Will he go to our countrymen abroad, and teach foreigners?
<verse eID="John.7.35" />
<verse sID="John.7.36" osisID="John.7.36" n="36" />What does he mean by saying <q who="Jesus" marker="">‘You will look for me, and you will not find me; and you will not be able to come where I will be’?”</q>
<verse eID="John.7.36" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.7.37" osisID="John.7.37" n="37" />On the last and greatest day of the Festival, Jesus, who was standing by, exclaimed, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“If anyone thirsts, they should come to me, and drink.</q>
<verse eID="John.7.37" />
<verse sID="John.7.38" osisID="John.7.38" n="38" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">I tell you what I have myself seen in the presence of my Father; and you, in the same way, do what you have learned from your father.”</q>
<verse eID="John.7.38" />
<verse sID="John.7.39" osisID="John.7.39" n="39" />(By this he meant the Spirit, which those who had believed in him were to receive; for the Spirit had not yet come, because Jesus had not yet been exalted.)
<verse eID="John.7.39" />
<verse sID="John.7.40" osisID="John.7.40" n="40" />Some of the people, when they heard these words, said, “This is certainly the Prophet!”;
<verse eID="John.7.40" />
<verse sID="John.7.41" osisID="John.7.41" n="41" />others said, “the Christ!”; but some asked, “What! Does the Christ come from Galilee?
<verse eID="John.7.41" />
<verse sID="John.7.42" osisID="John.7.42" n="42" />Is not it said in scripture that it is of the descendants of David, and from Bethlehem, the village to which David belonged, that the Christ is to come?”
<verse eID="John.7.42" />
<verse sID="John.7.43" osisID="John.7.43" n="43" />So there was a sharp division among the people because of Jesus.
<verse eID="John.7.43" />
<verse sID="John.7.44" osisID="John.7.44" n="44" />Some of them wanted to arrest him, and yet no one touched him.
<verse eID="John.7.44" />
<verse sID="John.7.45" osisID="John.7.45" n="45" />When the officers returned to the chief priests and Pharisees, they were asked, “Why have you not brought him?”
<verse eID="John.7.45" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.7.46" osisID="John.7.46" n="46" />“No one ever spoke as he speaks!” they answered.
<verse eID="John.7.46" />
<verse sID="John.7.47" osisID="John.7.47" n="47" />“What! Have you been led astray too?” the Pharisees replied.
<verse eID="John.7.47" />
<verse sID="John.7.48" osisID="John.7.48" n="48" />“Have any of our leading men believed in him, or any of the Pharisees?
<verse eID="John.7.48" />
<verse sID="John.7.49" osisID="John.7.49" n="49" />As for these people who do not know the Law – they are cursed!”
<verse eID="John.7.49" />
<verse sID="John.7.50" osisID="John.7.50" n="50" />But one of their number, Nicodemus, who before this had been to see Jesus, said to them,
<verse eID="John.7.50" />
<verse sID="John.7.51" osisID="John.7.51" n="51" />“Does our Law pass judgment on a person without first giving them a hearing, and finding out what they have been doing?”
<verse eID="John.7.51" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.7.52" osisID="John.7.52" n="52" />“Are you also from Galilee?” they retorted. “Search, and you will find that no prophet is to arise in Galilee!”
<verse eID="John.7.52" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.7.53" osisID="John.7.53" n="53" />And everyone went home
<verse eID="John.7.53" />
<chapter eID="John.7" />
<chapter sID="John.8" osisID="John.8" n="8" />
<verse sID="John.8.1" osisID="John.8.1" n="1" />except Jesus, who went to the Mount of Olives<note placement="foot"><reference type="annotateRef">8:1 </reference>This passage is inserted in some manuscripts from an ancient source, and found either after John 7:53 or after Luke 21:38 or elsewhere.</note>.
<verse eID="John.8.1" />
<verse sID="John.8.2" osisID="John.8.2" n="2" />But he went again into the Temple Courts early in the morning, and all the people came to him; and he sat down and taught them.
<verse eID="John.8.2" />
<verse sID="John.8.3" osisID="John.8.3" n="3" />Presently, however, the Teachers of the Law and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery, and placed her in the middle of the Court,
<verse eID="John.8.3" />
<verse sID="John.8.4" osisID="John.8.4" n="4" />and said to Jesus, “Teacher, this woman was found in the act of adultery.
<verse eID="John.8.4" />
<verse sID="John.8.5" osisID="John.8.5" n="5" />Now Moses, in the Law, commanded us to stone such women to death; what do you say?”
<verse eID="John.8.5" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.8.6" osisID="John.8.6" n="6" />They said this to test him, in order to have a charge to bring against him. But Jesus stooped down, and wrote on the ground with his finger.
<verse eID="John.8.6" />
<verse sID="John.8.7" osisID="John.8.7" n="7" />However, as they continued asking him, he raised himself, and said, “Let the person among you who has never done wrong throw the first stone at her.”
<verse eID="John.8.7" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.8.8" osisID="John.8.8" n="8" />And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.
<verse eID="John.8.8" />
<verse sID="John.8.9" osisID="John.8.9" n="9" />When they heard that, they went out one by one, beginning with the eldest; and Jesus was left alone with the woman in the middle of the Court.
<verse eID="John.8.9" />
<verse sID="John.8.10" osisID="John.8.10" n="10" />Raising himself, Jesus said to her, “Woman, where are they? Did no one condemn you?”
<verse eID="John.8.10" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.8.11" osisID="John.8.11" n="11" />“No one, Sir,” she answered.
</p>
<p>
“Neither do I condemn you,” said Jesus “go, and do not sin again.”
<verse eID="John.8.11" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.8.12" osisID="John.8.12" n="12" />Jesus again addressed the people. <q who="Jesus" marker="">“I am the light of the world,”</q>  he said. <q who="Jesus" marker="">“The person who follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.”</q>
<verse eID="John.8.12" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.8.13" osisID="John.8.13" n="13" />“You are bearing testimony to yourself!” exclaimed the Pharisees, “your testimony is not trustworthy.”

</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.8.14" osisID="John.8.14" n="14" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Even if I bear testimony to myself,”</q>  answered Jesus, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“my testimony is trustworthy; for I know where I came from, and where I am going; but you do not know where I come from, nor where I am going.</q>

<verse eID="John.8.19" />
<verse sID="John.8.20" osisID="John.8.20" n="20" />These statements Jesus made in the Treasury, while teaching in the Temple Courts. Yet no one arrested him, for his time had not then come.
<verse eID="John.8.20" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.8.21" osisID="John.8.21" n="21" />Jesus again spoke to the people. <q who="Jesus" marker="">“I am going away,”</q>  he said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“and you will look for me, but you will die in your sin; you cannot come where I am going.”</q>
<verse eID="John.8.21" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.8.22" osisID="John.8.22" n="22" />“Is he going to kill himself,” the people exclaimed, “that he says – <q who="Jesus" marker="">‘You cannot go where I am going’?”</q>

<p>
<verse sID="John.8.25" osisID="John.8.25" n="25" />“Who are you?” they asked. <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Why ask exactly what I have been telling you?”</q>  said Jesus.

<verse eID="John.8.27" />
<verse sID="John.8.28" osisID="John.8.28" n="28" />So Jesus added, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will understand that I am what I am, and that I do nothing of myself, but that I say just what the Father has taught me.</q>

<verse eID="John.9.5" />
<verse sID="John.9.6" osisID="John.9.6" n="6" />Saying this, Jesus spat on the ground, made clay with the saliva, and put it on the man’s eyes.

<verse sID="John.9.8" osisID="John.9.8" n="8" />His neighbors, and those who had formerly known him by sight as a beggar, exclaimed, “Is not this the man who used to sit and beg?”

</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.9.9" osisID="John.9.9" n="9" />“Yes,” some said, “it is”; while others said, “No, but he is like him.” The man himself said, “I am he.”
<verse eID="John.9.9" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.9.10" osisID="John.9.10" n="10" />“How did you get your sight, then?” they asked.
<verse eID="John.9.10" />
<verse sID="John.9.11" osisID="John.9.11" n="11" />“The man whom they call Jesus,” he answered, “made clay, and anointed my eyes, and said to me <q who="Jesus" marker="">‘Go to Siloam and wash your eyes.’</q>  So I went and washed my eyes, and gained my sight.”

</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.9.12" osisID="John.9.12" n="12" />“Where is he?” they asked. “I do not know,” he answered.
<verse eID="John.9.12" />
<verse sID="John.9.13" osisID="John.9.13" n="13" />They took the man, who had been blind, to the Pharisees.
<verse eID="John.9.13" />
<verse sID="John.9.14" osisID="John.9.14" n="14" />Now it was a Sabbath when Jesus made the clay and gave him his sight.
<verse eID="John.9.14" />
<verse sID="John.9.15" osisID="John.9.15" n="15" />So the Pharisees also questioned the man as to how he had gained his sight. “He put clay on my eyes,” he answered, “and I washed them, and I can see.”
<verse eID="John.9.15" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.9.16" osisID="John.9.16" n="16" />“The man cannot be from God,” said some of the Pharisees, “for he does not keep the Sabbath.”

“How is it possible,” retorted others, “for a bad man to give signs like this?”
<verse eID="John.9.16" />
<verse sID="John.9.17" osisID="John.9.17" n="17" />So there was a difference of opinion among them, and they again questioned the man. “What do you yourself say about him, for it is to you that he has given sight?”
<verse eID="John.9.17" />
<verse sID="John.9.18" osisID="John.9.18" n="18" />The religious authorities, however, refused to believe that he had been blind and had gained his sight, until they had called his parents and questioned them.
<verse eID="John.9.18" />
<verse sID="John.9.19" osisID="John.9.19" n="19" />“Is this your son,” they asked, “who you say was born blind? If so, how is it that he can see now?”
<verse eID="John.9.19" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.9.20" osisID="John.9.20" n="20" />“We know that this is our son,” answered the parents, “and that he was born blind;

<verse sID="John.9.21" osisID="John.9.21" n="21" />but how it is that he can see now we do not know; nor do we know who it was that gave him his sight. Ask him – he is old enough – he will tell you about himself.”
<verse eID="John.9.21" />
<verse sID="John.9.22" osisID="John.9.22" n="22" />His parents spoke in this way because they were afraid of the authorities; for the authorities had already agreed that, if anyone should acknowledge Jesus as the Christ, he should be expelled from their synagogues.
<verse eID="John.9.22" />
<verse sID="John.9.23" osisID="John.9.23" n="23" />This was why his parents said ‘He is old enough; ask him.’
<verse eID="John.9.23" />
<verse sID="John.9.24" osisID="John.9.24" n="24" />So the authorities again called the man who had been blind, and said to him, “Give God the praise; we know that this is a bad man.”
<verse eID="John.9.24" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.9.25" osisID="John.9.25" n="25" />“I know nothing about his being a bad man,” he replied. “One thing I do know, that although I was blind, now I can see.”
<verse eID="John.9.25" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.9.26" osisID="John.9.26" n="26" />“What did he do to you?” they asked. “How did he give you your sight?”
<verse eID="John.9.26" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.9.27" osisID="John.9.27" n="27" />“I told you just now,” he answered, “and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Surely you also do not want to become his disciples?”
<verse eID="John.9.27" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.9.28" osisID="John.9.28" n="28" />“You are his disciple,” they retorted scornfully. “But we are disciples of Moses.
<verse eID="John.9.28" />
<verse sID="John.9.29" osisID="John.9.29" n="29" />We know that God spoke to Moses; but, as for this man, we do not know where he comes from.”
<verse eID="John.9.29" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.9.30" osisID="John.9.30" n="30" />“Well,” the man replied, “this is very strange; you do not know where he comes from, and yet he has given me my sight!
<verse eID="John.9.30" />
<verse sID="John.9.31" osisID="John.9.31" n="31" />We know that God never listens to bad people, but, when a person is god-fearing and does God’s will, God listens to them.
<verse eID="John.9.31" />
<verse sID="John.9.32" osisID="John.9.32" n="32" />Since the world began, such a thing was never heard of as anyone’s giving sight to a person born blind.
<verse eID="John.9.32" />
<verse sID="John.9.33" osisID="John.9.33" n="33" />If this man had not been from God, he could not have done anything at all.”
<verse eID="John.9.33" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.9.34" osisID="John.9.34" n="34" />“You,” they retorted, “were born totally depraved; and are you trying to teach us?” So they expelled him.
<verse eID="John.9.34" />
<verse sID="John.9.35" osisID="John.9.35" n="35" />Jesus heard of their having put him out; and, when he had found the man, he asked, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Do you believe in the Son of Man?”</q>
<verse eID="John.9.35" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.9.36" osisID="John.9.36" n="36" />“Tell me who he is, Sir,” he replied, “so that I may believe in him.”

<verse sID="John.9.38" osisID="John.9.38" n="38" />“Then, Sir, I do believe,” said the man, bowing to the ground before him;
<verse eID="John.9.38" />
<verse sID="John.9.39" osisID="John.9.39" n="39" />and Jesus added, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“It was to put people to the test that I came into this world, in order that those that cannot see should see, and that those that can see should become blind.”</q>
<verse eID="John.9.39" />
<verse sID="John.9.40" osisID="John.9.40" n="40" />Hearing this, some of the Pharisees who were with him said, “Then are we blind too?”

<verse sID="John.10.39" osisID="John.10.39" n="39" />The authorities again sought to arrest him; but he escaped their hands.
<verse eID="John.10.39" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.10.40" osisID="John.10.40" n="40" />Then Jesus again crossed the Jordan to the place where John used to baptize at first, and stayed there some time, during which many people came to see him.
<verse eID="John.10.40" />
<verse sID="John.10.41" osisID="John.10.41" n="41" />“John gave no sign of his mission,” they said. “But everything that he said about this man was true.”
<verse eID="John.10.41" />
<verse sID="John.10.42" osisID="John.10.42" n="42" />And many learned to believe in Jesus there.

<p>
<chapter sID="John.11" osisID="John.11" n="11" />
<verse sID="John.11.1" osisID="John.11.1" n="1" />Now a man named Lazarus, of Bethany, was lying ill; he belonged to the same village as Mary and her sister Martha.
<verse eID="John.11.1" />
<verse sID="John.11.2" osisID="John.11.2" n="2" />This Mary, whose brother Lazarus was ill, was the Mary who anointed the Master with perfume, and wiped his feet with her hair.
<verse eID="John.11.2" />
<verse sID="John.11.3" osisID="John.11.3" n="3" />The sisters, therefore, sent this message to Jesus – ‘Master, your friend is ill’;
<verse eID="John.11.3" />
<verse sID="John.11.4" osisID="John.11.4" n="4" />and, when Jesus heard it, he said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“This illness is not to end in death, but is to redound to the honor of God, in order that the Son of God may be honored through it.”</q>
<verse eID="John.11.4" />
<verse sID="John.11.5" osisID="John.11.5" n="5" />Jesus loved Martha and her sister, and Lazarus.
<verse eID="John.11.5" />
<verse sID="John.11.6" osisID="John.11.6" n="6" />Yet, when he heard of the illness of Lazarus, he still stayed two days in the place where he was.
<verse eID="John.11.6" />
<verse sID="John.11.7" osisID="John.11.7" n="7" />Then, after that, he said to his disciples, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Let us go to Judea again.”</q>
<verse eID="John.11.7" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.11.8" osisID="John.11.8" n="8" />“Rabbi,” they replied, “the authorities there were but just now seeking to stone you; and are you going there again?”
<verse eID="John.11.8" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.11.9" osisID="John.11.9" n="9" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Are not there twelve hours in the day?”</q>  answered Jesus. <q who="Jesus" marker="">“If someone walks about in the daytime, they don’t stumble, because they can see the light of the sun;</q>
<verse eID="John.11.9" />
<verse sID="John.11.10" osisID="John.11.10" n="10" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">but, if they walk about at night, they stumble, because they have not the light.”</q>
<verse eID="John.11.10" />
<verse sID="John.11.11" osisID="John.11.11" n="11" />And, when he had said this, he added, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I am going so that I may wake him.”</q>
<verse eID="John.11.11" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.11.12" osisID="John.11.12" n="12" />“If he has fallen asleep, Master, he will get well,” said the disciples.
<verse eID="John.11.12" />
<verse sID="John.11.13" osisID="John.11.13" n="13" />But Jesus meant that he was dead; they, however, supposed that he was speaking of natural sleep.
<verse eID="John.11.13" />
<verse sID="John.11.14" osisID="John.11.14" n="14" />Then he said to them plainly, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Lazarus is dead;</q>
<verse eID="John.11.14" />
<verse sID="John.11.15" osisID="John.11.15" n="15" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">and I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, so that you may learn to believe in me. But let us go to him.”</q>
<verse eID="John.11.15" />
<verse sID="John.11.16" osisID="John.11.16" n="16" />At this, Thomas, who was called ‘The Twin,’ said to his fellow disciples, “Let us go too, so that we may die with him.”
<verse eID="John.11.16" />
<verse sID="John.11.17" osisID="John.11.17" n="17" />When Jesus reached the place, he found that Lazarus had been four days in the tomb already.
<verse eID="John.11.17" />
<verse sID="John.11.18" osisID="John.11.18" n="18" />Bethany being only about two miles from Jerusalem,
<verse eID="John.11.18" />
<verse sID="John.11.19" osisID="John.11.19" n="19" />a number of the people had come there to comfort Martha and Mary because of brother’s death.
<verse eID="John.11.19" />
<verse sID="John.11.20" osisID="John.11.20" n="20" />When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went to meet him; but Mary sat quietly at home.
<verse eID="John.11.20" />
<verse sID="John.11.21" osisID="John.11.21" n="21" />“Master,” Martha said to Jesus, “if you had been here, my brother would not have died.
<verse eID="John.11.21" />
<verse sID="John.11.22" osisID="John.11.22" n="22" />Even now, I know that God will grant you whatever you ask him.”

</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.11.23" osisID="John.11.23" n="23" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Your brother will rise to life,”</q>  said Jesus.
<verse eID="John.11.23" />
<verse sID="John.11.24" osisID="John.11.24" n="24" />“I know that he will,” replied Martha, “in the resurrection at the Last day.”
<verse eID="John.11.24" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.11.25" osisID="John.11.25" n="25" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“I am the resurrection and the life,”</q>  said Jesus. <q who="Jesus" marker="">“He who believes in me will live, though he die;</q>
<verse eID="John.11.25" />
<verse sID="John.11.26" osisID="John.11.26" n="26" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">and he who lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?”</q>
<verse eID="John.11.26" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.11.27" osisID="John.11.27" n="27" />“Yes Master,” she answered. “I have learned to believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.”
<verse eID="John.11.27" />
<verse sID="John.11.28" osisID="John.11.28" n="28" />After saying this, Martha went and called her sister Mary, and whispered, “The teacher is here, and is asking for you.”
<verse eID="John.11.28" />
<verse sID="John.11.29" osisID="John.11.29" n="29" />As soon as Mary heard that, she got up quickly, and went to meet him.
<verse eID="John.11.29" />
<verse sID="John.11.30" osisID="John.11.30" n="30" />Jesus had not then come into the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met him.
<verse eID="John.11.30" />
<verse sID="John.11.31" osisID="John.11.31" n="31" />So the people, who were in the house with Mary, comforting her, when they saw her get up quickly and go out, followed her, thinking that she was going to the tomb to weep there.
<verse eID="John.11.31" />
<verse sID="John.11.32" osisID="John.11.32" n="32" />When Mary came where Jesus was and saw him, she threw herself at his feet. “Master,” she exclaimed, “if you had been here, my brother would not have died!”
<verse eID="John.11.32" />
<verse sID="John.11.33" osisID="John.11.33" n="33" />When Jesus saw her weeping, and the people who had come with her weeping also, he groaned deeply, and was greatly distressed.
<verse eID="John.11.33" />
<verse sID="John.11.34" osisID="John.11.34" n="34" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Where have you buried him?”</q>  he asked. “Come and see, Master,” they answered.
<verse eID="John.11.34" />
<verse sID="John.11.35" osisID="John.11.35" n="35" />Jesus burst into tears.
<verse eID="John.11.35" />
<verse sID="John.11.36" osisID="John.11.36" n="36" />“How he must have loved him!” the people exclaimed;
<verse eID="John.11.36" />
<verse sID="John.11.37" osisID="John.11.37" n="37" />but some of them said, “Could not this man, who gave sight to the blind man, have also prevented Lazarus from dying?”
<verse eID="John.11.37" />
<verse sID="John.11.38" osisID="John.11.38" n="38" />Again groaning inwardly, Jesus came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay against the mouth of it.
<verse eID="John.11.38" />
<verse sID="John.11.39" osisID="John.11.39" n="39" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Move the stone away,”</q>  said Jesus. “Master,” said Martha, the sister of the dead man, “by this time the smell must be offensive, for this is the fourth day since his death.”
<verse eID="John.11.39" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.11.40" osisID="John.11.40" n="40" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Didn’t I tell you,”</q>  replied Jesus, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“that, if you would believe in me, you should see the glory of God?”</q>
<verse eID="John.11.40" />
<verse sID="John.11.41" osisID="John.11.41" n="41" />So they moved the stone away; and Jesus, with uplifted eyes, said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Father, I thank you that you have heard my prayer;</q>
<verse eID="John.11.41" />
<verse sID="John.11.42" osisID="John.11.42" n="42" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">I know that you always hear me; but I say this for the sake of the people standing near, so that they may believe that you has sent me as your messenger.”</q>
<verse eID="John.11.42" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.11.43" osisID="John.11.43" n="43" />Then, after saying this, Jesus called in a loud voice, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Lazarus! Come out!”</q>
<verse eID="John.11.43" />
<verse sID="John.11.44" osisID="John.11.44" n="44" />The dead man came out, wrapped hand and foot in a winding-sheet; his face, too, had been wrapped in a cloth. <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Set him free,”</q>  said Jesus, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“and let him go.”</q>
<verse eID="John.11.44" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.11.45" osisID="John.11.45" n="45" />In consequence of this, many of the people, who had come to visit Mary and had seen what Jesus did, learned to believe in him.
<verse eID="John.11.45" />
<verse sID="John.11.46" osisID="John.11.46" n="46" />Some of them, however, went to the Pharisees, and told them what he had done.
<verse eID="John.11.46" />
<verse sID="John.11.47" osisID="John.11.47" n="47" />The chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the High Council, and said, “What are we to do, now that this man is giving so many signs?
<verse eID="John.11.47" />
<verse sID="John.11.48" osisID="John.11.48" n="48" />If we allow him to continue as we are doing, everyone will believe in him; and the Romans will come and will take from us both our city and our Nationality.”
<verse eID="John.11.48" />
<verse sID="John.11.49" osisID="John.11.49" n="49" />One of them, however, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them,
<verse eID="John.11.49" />
<verse sID="John.11.50" osisID="John.11.50" n="50" />“You are utterly mistaken. You do not consider that it is better for you that one person should die for the people, rather than the whole nation should be destroyed.”
<verse eID="John.11.50" />
<verse sID="John.11.51" osisID="John.11.51" n="51" />Now he did not say this of his own accord; but, as high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was to die for the nation –
<verse eID="John.11.51" />
<verse sID="John.11.52" osisID="John.11.52" n="52" />And not for the nation only, but also that he might unite in one body the children of God now scattered far and wide.
<verse eID="John.11.52" />
<verse sID="John.11.53" osisID="John.11.53" n="53" />So from that day they plotted to put Jesus to death.
<verse eID="John.11.53" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.11.54" osisID="John.11.54" n="54" />In consequence of this, Jesus did not go about publicly among the people any more, but left and went into the country bordering on the wilderness, to a town called Ephraim, where he stayed with his disciples.
<verse eID="John.11.54" />
<verse sID="John.11.55" osisID="John.11.55" n="55" />But the Jewish Festival of the Passover was near; and many people had gone up from the country to Jerusalem, for their purification, before the Festival began.
<verse eID="John.11.55" />
<verse sID="John.11.56" osisID="John.11.56" n="56" />So they looked for Jesus there, and said to one another, as they stood in the Temple Courts, “What do you think? Do you think he will come to the Festival?”
<verse eID="John.11.56" />
<verse sID="John.11.57" osisID="John.11.57" n="57" />The chief priests and the Pharisees had already issued orders that, if anyone learned where Jesus was, he should give information, so that they might arrest him.

<!-- s --><title>The Last Days</title>
<p>
<verse sID="John.12.1" osisID="John.12.1" n="1" />Six days before the Passover Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead, was living.
<verse eID="John.12.1" />
<verse sID="John.12.2" osisID="John.12.2" n="2" />There a supper was given in honor at which Martha waited, while Lazarus was one of those present at the table.
<verse eID="John.12.2" />
<verse sID="John.12.3" osisID="John.12.3" n="3" />So Mary took a pound of choice spikenard perfume of great value, and anointed the feet of Jesus with it, and then wiped them with her hair. The whole house was filled with the scent of the perfume.
<verse eID="John.12.3" />
<verse sID="John.12.4" osisID="John.12.4" n="4" />One of the disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was about to betray Jesus, asked,
<verse eID="John.12.4" />
<verse sID="John.12.5" osisID="John.12.5" n="5" />“Why was not this perfume sold for a year’s wages, and the money given to poor people?”
<verse eID="John.12.5" />
<verse sID="John.12.6" osisID="John.12.6" n="6" />He said this, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and, being in charge of the purse, used to take what was put in it.
<verse eID="John.12.6" />
<verse sID="John.12.7" osisID="John.12.7" n="7" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Leave her alone,”</q>  said Jesus, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“so that she may keep it until the day when my body is being prepared for burial.</q>
<verse eID="John.12.7" />
<verse sID="John.12.8" osisID="John.12.8" n="8" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">The poor you always have with you, but you will not always have me.”</q>
<verse eID="John.12.8" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.12.9" osisID="John.12.9" n="9" />Now great numbers of people found out that Jesus was at Bethany; and they came there, not only because of him, but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.
<verse eID="John.12.9" />
<verse sID="John.12.10" osisID="John.12.10" n="10" />The chief priests, however, plotted to put Lazarus, as well as Jesus, to death,
<verse eID="John.12.10" />
<verse sID="John.12.11" osisID="John.12.11" n="11" />because it was owing to him that many of the people had left them, and were becoming believers in Jesus.
<verse eID="John.12.11" />
<verse sID="John.12.12" osisID="John.12.12" n="12" />On the following day great numbers of people who had come to the Festival, hearing that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem, took palm branches,
<verse eID="John.12.12" />
<verse sID="John.12.13" osisID="John.12.13" n="13" />and went out to meet him, shouting as they went, “God save Him! Blessed is He who Comes in the name of the Lord – The king of Israel!”
<verse eID="John.12.13" />
<verse sID="John.12.14" osisID="John.12.14" n="14" />Having found a young ass, Jesus seated himself on it, in accordance with the passage of scripture –
<verse eID="John.12.14" />
<verse sID="John.12.15" osisID="John.12.15" n="15" />‘Fear not, people of Zion; Your king is coming to you, Sitting on the foal of an ass.’
<verse eID="John.12.15" />
<verse sID="John.12.16" osisID="John.12.16" n="16" />His disciples did not understand all this at first; but, when Jesus had been exalted, then they remembered that these things had been said of him in scripture, and that they had done these things for him.
<verse eID="John.12.16" />
<verse sID="John.12.17" osisID="John.12.17" n="17" />Meanwhile the people who were with him, when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead, were telling what they had seen.
<verse eID="John.12.17" />
<verse sID="John.12.18" osisID="John.12.18" n="18" />This, indeed, was why the crowd met him – because people had heard that he had given this sign of his mission.
<verse eID="John.12.18" />
<verse sID="John.12.19" osisID="John.12.19" n="19" />So the Pharisees said to one another, “You see that you are gaining nothing! Why, all the world has run after him!”
<verse eID="John.12.19" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.12.20" osisID="John.12.20" n="20" />Among those who were going up to worship at the Festival were some Greeks,
<verse eID="John.12.20" />
<verse sID="John.12.21" osisID="John.12.21" n="21" />who went to Philip of Bethsaida in Galilee, and said, “Sir, we wish to see Jesus.”
<verse eID="John.12.21" />
<verse sID="John.12.22" osisID="John.12.22" n="22" />Philip went and told Andrew, and then together they went and told Jesus.
<verse eID="John.12.22" />
<verse sID="John.12.23" osisID="John.12.23" n="23" />This was his reply – <q who="Jesus" marker="">“The time has come for the Son of Man to be exalted.</q>
<verse eID="John.12.23" />
<verse sID="John.12.24" osisID="John.12.24" n="24" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">In truth I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains solitary; but, if it dies, it becomes fruitful.</q>

<verse eID="John.12.28" />
<verse sID="John.12.29" osisID="John.12.29" n="29" />The crowd of bystanders, who heard the sound, said that it was thundering. Others said, “An angel has been speaking to him.”
<verse eID="John.12.29" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.12.30" osisID="John.12.30" n="30" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“It was not for my sake that the voice came,”</q>  said Jesus, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“but for yours.</q>

<verse eID="John.12.32" />
<verse sID="John.12.33" osisID="John.12.33" n="33" />By these words he indicated what death he was destined to die.
<verse eID="John.12.33" />
<verse sID="John.12.34" osisID="John.12.34" n="34" />“We,” replied the people, “have learned from the Law that the Christ is to remain for ever; how is it, then, that you say that the Son of Man must be <q who="Jesus" marker="">‘lifted up’</q>  Who is this ‘Son of Man’?”
<verse eID="John.12.34" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.12.35" osisID="John.12.35" n="35" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Only a little while longer,”</q>  answered Jesus, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“will you have the light among you.

<verse eID="John.12.36" />
<verse sID="John.12.37" osisID="John.12.37" n="37" />But, though Jesus had given so many signs of his mission before their eyes, they still did not believe in him,
<verse eID="John.12.37" />
<verse sID="John.12.38" osisID="John.12.38" n="38" />in fulfillment of the words of the prophet Isaiah, where he says – ‘Lord, who has believed our teaching? And to whom has the might of the Lord been revealed?’

<verse eID="John.18.1" />

<verse eID="John.18.6" />
<verse sID="John.18.7" osisID="John.18.7" n="7" />So he again asked for whom they were looking, and they answered, “Jesus of Nazareth.”

<verse sID="John.18.19" osisID="John.18.19" n="19" />The high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching.

<verse sID="John.18.20" osisID="John.18.20" n="20" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“For my part,”</q>  answered Jesus, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“I have spoken to all the world openly. I always taught in some synagogue, or in the Temple Courts, places where everyone assembles, and I never spoke of anything in secret.</q>
<verse eID="John.18.20" />
<verse sID="John.18.21" osisID="John.18.21" n="21" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">Why question me? Question those who have listened to me as to what I have spoken about to them. They must know what I said.”</q>
<verse eID="John.18.21" />
<verse sID="John.18.22" osisID="John.18.22" n="22" />When Jesus said this, one of the police officers, who was standing near, gave him a blow with his hand. “Do you answer the high priest like that?” he exclaimed.
<verse eID="John.18.22" />
<verse sID="John.18.23" osisID="John.18.23" n="23" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“If I said anything wrong, give evidence about it,”</q>  replied Jesus, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“but if not, why do you strike me?”</q>
<verse eID="John.18.23" />
<verse sID="John.18.24" osisID="John.18.24" n="24" />Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.
<verse eID="John.18.24" />
<verse sID="John.18.25" osisID="John.18.25" n="25" />Meanwhile Simon Peter was standing there, warming himself; so they said to him, “Aren’t you also one of his disciples?” Peter denied it. “No, I am not,” he said.
<verse eID="John.18.25" />
<verse sID="John.18.26" osisID="John.18.26" n="26" />One of the high priest’s servants, a relation of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, exclaimed, “Didn’t I myself see you with him in the garden?”
<verse eID="John.18.26" />
<verse sID="John.18.27" osisID="John.18.27" n="27" />Peter again denied it; and at that moment a cock crowed.
<verse eID="John.18.27" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.18.28" osisID="John.18.28" n="28" />From Caiaphas they took Jesus to the Government house. It was early in the morning. But they did not enter the Government house themselves, otherwise they might become defiled, and so be unable to eat the Passover.
<verse eID="John.18.28" />
<verse sID="John.18.29" osisID="John.18.29" n="29" />Therefore Pilate came outside to speak to them. “What charge do you bring against this man?” he asked.
<verse eID="John.18.29" />
<verse sID="John.18.30" osisID="John.18.30" n="30" />“If he had not been a criminal, we should not have given him up to you,” they answered.
<verse eID="John.18.30" />
<verse sID="John.18.31" osisID="John.18.31" n="31" />“Take him yourselves,” said Pilate, “and try him by your own Law.”
</p>
<p>
“We have no power to put anyone to death,” the authorities replied –
<verse eID="John.18.31" />
<verse sID="John.18.32" osisID="John.18.32" n="32" />In fulfillment of what Jesus had said when indicating the death that he was destined to die.
<verse eID="John.18.32" />
<verse sID="John.18.33" osisID="John.18.33" n="33" />After that, Pilate went into the Government house again, and calling Jesus up, asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?”
<verse eID="John.18.33" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.18.34" osisID="John.18.34" n="34" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Do you ask me that yourself?”</q>  replied Jesus, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“or did others say it to you about me?”</q>
<verse eID="John.18.34" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.18.35" osisID="John.18.35" n="35" />“Do you take me for a Jew?” was Pilate’s answer. “It is your own nation and the chief priests who have given you up to me. What have you done?”
<verse eID="John.18.35" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.18.36" osisID="John.18.36" n="36" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“My kingly power,”</q>  replied Jesus, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“is not due to this world. If it had been so, my servants would be doing their utmost to prevent my being given up to the authorities; but my kingly power is not from the world.”</q>
<verse eID="John.18.36" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.18.37" osisID="John.18.37" n="37" />“So you are a king after all!” exclaimed Pilate. <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Yes, it is true I am a king,”</q>  answered Jesus. <q who="Jesus" marker="">“I was born for this, I have come into the world for this – to bear testimony to the truth. Everyone who is on the side of truth listens to my voice.”</q>
<verse eID="John.18.37" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.18.38" osisID="John.18.38" n="38" />“What is truth?” exclaimed Pilate. After saying this, he went out to the crowd again, and said, “For my part, I find nothing with which he can be charged.
<verse eID="John.18.38" />
<verse sID="John.18.39" osisID="John.18.39" n="39" />It is, however, the custom for me to grant you the release of one man at the Passover Festival. Do you wish for the release of the king of the Jews?”
<verse eID="John.18.39" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.18.40" osisID="John.18.40" n="40" />“No, not this man,” they shouted again, “but Barabbas!” This Barabbas was a robber.
<verse eID="John.18.40" />
<chapter eID="John.18" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="John.19" osisID="John.19" n="19" />
<verse sID="John.19.1" osisID="John.19.1" n="1" />After that, Pilate had Jesus scourged.
<verse eID="John.19.1" />
<verse sID="John.19.2" osisID="John.19.2" n="2" />The soldiers made a crown with some thorns and put it on his head and threw a purple robe around him.
<verse eID="John.19.2" />
<verse sID="John.19.3" osisID="John.19.3" n="3" />They kept coming up to him and saying, “Long live the king of the Jews!” and they gave him blow after blow with their hands.
<verse eID="John.19.3" />
<verse sID="John.19.4" osisID="John.19.4" n="4" />Pilate again came outside, and said to the people, “Look! I am bringing him out to you, so that you may know that I find nothing with which he can be charged.”
<verse eID="John.19.4" />
<verse sID="John.19.5" osisID="John.19.5" n="5" />Then Jesus came outside, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe; and Pilate said to them, “Here is the man!”
<verse eID="John.19.5" />
<verse sID="John.19.6" osisID="John.19.6" n="6" />When the chief priests and the police officers saw him, they shouted, “Crucify him! Crucify him!”
</p>
<p>
“Take him yourselves and crucify him,” said Pilate. “For my part, I find nothing with which he can be charged.”
<verse eID="John.19.6" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.19.7" osisID="John.19.7" n="7" />“But we,” replied the crowd, “have a Law, under which he deserves death for making himself out to be the Son of God.”
<verse eID="John.19.7" />
<verse sID="John.19.8" osisID="John.19.8" n="8" />When Pilate heard what they said, he became still more alarmed;
<verse eID="John.19.8" />
<verse sID="John.19.9" osisID="John.19.9" n="9" />and, going into the Government house again, he said to Jesus, “Where do you come from?”
<verse eID="John.19.9" />
<verse sID="John.19.10" osisID="John.19.10" n="10" />But Jesus made no reply. So Pilate said to him, “Do you refuse to speak to me? Don’t you know that I have power to release you, and have power to crucify you?”
<verse eID="John.19.10" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.19.11" osisID="John.19.11" n="11" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“You would have no power over me at all,”</q>  answered Jesus, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“if it had not been given you from above; and, therefore, the man who betrayed me to you is guilty of the greater sin.”</q>
<verse eID="John.19.11" />
<verse sID="John.19.12" osisID="John.19.12" n="12" />This made Pilate anxious to release him; but the crowd shouted, “If you release that man, you are no friend of the Emperor! Anyone who makes himself out to be a king is setting himself against the Emperor!”
<verse eID="John.19.12" />
<verse sID="John.19.13" osisID="John.19.13" n="13" />On hearing what they said, Pilate brought Jesus out, and took his seat on the Bench at a place called ‘The Stone Pavement’ – in Hebrew ‘Gabbatha.’
<verse eID="John.19.13" />
<verse sID="John.19.14" osisID="John.19.14" n="14" />It was the Passover Preparation day, and about noon. Then he said to the crowd, “Here is your king!”
<verse eID="John.19.14" />
<verse sID="John.19.15" osisID="John.19.15" n="15" />At that the people shouted, “Kill him! Kill him! Crucify him!”
</p>
<p>
“What! Should I crucify your king?” exclaimed Pilate. “We have no king but the Emperor,” replied the chief priests;
<verse eID="John.19.15" />
<verse sID="John.19.16" osisID="John.19.16" n="16" />so Pilate gave Jesus up to them to be crucified.
</p>
<p>
So they took Jesus;
<verse eID="John.19.16" />
<verse sID="John.19.17" osisID="John.19.17" n="17" />and he went out, carrying his cross himself, to the place which is named from a scull, or, in Hebrew, Golgotha.
<verse eID="John.19.17" />
<verse sID="John.19.18" osisID="John.19.18" n="18" />There they crucified him, and two others with him – one on each side, and Jesus between them.
<verse eID="John.19.18" />
<verse sID="John.19.19" osisID="John.19.19" n="19" />Pilate also had these words written and put up over the cross – ‘JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.’
<verse eID="John.19.19" />
<verse sID="John.19.20" osisID="John.19.20" n="20" />These words were read by many people, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and they were written in Hebrew, Latin and Greek.
<verse eID="John.19.20" />
<verse sID="John.19.21" osisID="John.19.21" n="21" />The chief priests said to Pilate, “Do not write ‘The king of the Jews’, but write what the man said – ‘I am the king of the Jews.’”
<verse eID="John.19.21" />
<verse sID="John.19.22" osisID="John.19.22" n="22" />But Pilate answered, “What I have written, I have written.”
<verse eID="John.19.22" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.19.23" osisID="John.19.23" n="23" />When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and divided them into four shares – a share for each soldier – and they took the coat also. The coat had no seam, being woven in one piece from top to bottom.
<verse eID="John.19.23" />
<verse sID="John.19.24" osisID="John.19.24" n="24" />So they said to one another, “Do not let us tear it, but let us cast lots for it, to see who will have it.” This was in fulfillment of the words of scripture –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘They shared my clothes among them,</l>
<l level="2">and over my clothing they cast lots.’</l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
That was what the soldiers did.
<verse eID="John.19.24" />
<verse sID="John.19.25" osisID="John.19.25" n="25" />Meanwhile near the cross of Jesus were standing his mother and his mother’s sister, as well as Mary the wife of Clopas and Mary of Magdala.
<verse eID="John.19.25" />
<verse sID="John.19.26" osisID="John.19.26" n="26" />When Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved, standing near, he said to his mother, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“There is your son.”</q>
<verse eID="John.19.26" />
<verse sID="John.19.27" osisID="John.19.27" n="27" />Then he said to that disciple, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“There is your mother.”</q>  And from that very hour the disciple took her to live in his house.
<verse eID="John.19.27" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.19.28" osisID="John.19.28" n="28" />Afterward, knowing that everything was now finished, Jesus said, in fulfillment of the words of scripture, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“I am thirsty.”</q>
<verse eID="John.19.28" />
<verse sID="John.19.29" osisID="John.19.29" n="29" />There was a bowl standing there full of common wine; so they put a sponge soaked in the wine on the end of a hyssop-stalk, and held it up to his mouth.
<verse eID="John.19.29" />
<verse sID="John.19.30" osisID="John.19.30" n="30" />When Jesus had received the wine, he exclaimed, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“All is finished!”</q>  Then, bowing his head, he resigned his spirit to God.
<verse eID="John.19.30" />
<verse sID="John.19.31" osisID="John.19.31" n="31" />It was the Preparation day, and so, to prevent the bodies from remaining on the crosses during the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a great day), the Jews asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies removed.
<verse eID="John.19.31" />
<verse sID="John.19.32" osisID="John.19.32" n="32" />Accordingly the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man, and then those of the other who had been crucified with Jesus;
<verse eID="John.19.32" />
<verse sID="John.19.33" osisID="John.19.33" n="33" />but, on coming to him, when they saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.
<verse eID="John.19.33" />
<verse sID="John.19.34" osisID="John.19.34" n="34" />One of the soldiers, however, pierced his side with a spear, and blood and water immediately flowed from it.
<verse eID="John.19.34" />
<verse sID="John.19.35" osisID="John.19.35" n="35" />This is the statement of one who actually saw it – and his statement may be relied on, and he knows that he is speaking the truth – and it is given in order that you also may be convinced.
<verse eID="John.19.35" />
<verse sID="John.19.36" osisID="John.19.36" n="36" />For all this happened in fulfillment of the words of scripture – ‘Not one of its bones will be broken.’
<verse eID="John.19.36" />
<verse sID="John.19.37" osisID="John.19.37" n="37" />And there is another passage which says – ‘They will look on him whom they pierced.’
<verse eID="John.19.37" />
<verse sID="John.19.38" osisID="John.19.38" n="38" />After this, Joseph of Ramah, a disciple of Jesus – but a secret one, owing to his fear of the religious authorities – begged Pilate’s permission to remove the body of Jesus. Pilate gave him leave; so Joseph went and removed the body.
<verse eID="John.19.38" />
<verse sID="John.19.39" osisID="John.19.39" n="39" />Nicodemus, too – the man who had formerly visited Jesus by night – came with a roll of myrrh and aloes, weighing nearly a hundred pounds.
<verse eID="John.19.39" />
<verse sID="John.19.40" osisID="John.19.40" n="40" />They took the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen with the spices, according to the Jewish mode of burial.
<verse eID="John.19.40" />
<verse sID="John.19.41" osisID="John.19.41" n="41" />At the place where Jesus had been crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a newly made tomb in which no one had ever been laid.
<verse eID="John.19.41" />
<verse sID="John.19.42" osisID="John.19.42" n="42" />And so, because of its being the Preparation day, and as the tomb was close at hand, they laid Jesus there.
<verse eID="John.19.42" />
<chapter eID="John.19" />
<chapter sID="John.20" osisID="John.20" n="20" />
</p>
<!-- s --><title>The Risen Life</title>
<p>
<verse sID="John.20.1" osisID="John.20.1" n="1" />On the first day of the week, early in the morning, while it was still dark, Mary of Magdala went to the tomb, and saw that the stone had been removed.
<verse eID="John.20.1" />
<verse sID="John.20.2" osisID="John.20.2" n="2" />So she came running to Simon Peter, and to that other disciple who was Jesus’ friend, and said to them, “They have taken away the Master out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him!”
<verse eID="John.20.2" />
<verse sID="John.20.3" osisID="John.20.3" n="3" />So, Peter started off with that other disciple, and they went to the tomb.
<verse eID="John.20.3" />
<verse sID="John.20.4" osisID="John.20.4" n="4" />The two began running together; but the other disciple ran faster than Peter, and reached the tomb first.
<verse eID="John.20.4" />
<verse sID="John.20.5" osisID="John.20.5" n="5" />Stooping down, he saw the linen wrappings lying there, but did not go in.
<verse eID="John.20.5" />
<verse sID="John.20.6" osisID="John.20.6" n="6" />Presently Simon Peter came following behind him, and went into the tomb; and he looked at the linen wrappings lying there,
<verse eID="John.20.6" />
<verse sID="John.20.7" osisID="John.20.7" n="7" />and the cloth which had been on Jesus’ head, not lying with the wrappings, but rolled up on one side, separately.
<verse eID="John.20.7" />
<verse sID="John.20.8" osisID="John.20.8" n="8" />Then the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, went inside too, and he saw for himself and was convinced.
<verse eID="John.20.8" />
<verse sID="John.20.9" osisID="John.20.9" n="9" />For they did not then understand the passage of scripture which says that Jesus must rise again from the dead.
<verse eID="John.20.9" />
<verse sID="John.20.10" osisID="John.20.10" n="10" />The disciples then returned to their companions.
<verse eID="John.20.10" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.20.11" osisID="John.20.11" n="11" />Meanwhile Mary was standing close outside the tomb, weeping. Still weeping, she leant forward into the tomb,
<verse eID="John.20.11" />
<verse sID="John.20.12" osisID="John.20.12" n="12" />and perceived two angels clothed in white sitting there, where the body of Jesus had been lying, one where the head and the other where the feet had been.
<verse eID="John.20.12" />
<verse sID="John.20.13" osisID="John.20.13" n="13" />“Why are you weeping?” asked the angels. “They have taken my Master away,” she answered, “and I do not know where they have laid him.”
<verse eID="John.20.13" />
<verse sID="John.20.14" osisID="John.20.14" n="14" />After saying this, she turned around, and looked at Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus.

<verse sID="John.20.15" osisID="John.20.15" n="15" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?”</q>  he asked. Supposing him to be the gardener, Mary answered, “If it was you, Sir, who carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away myself.”

</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.20.16" osisID="John.20.16" n="16" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Mary!”</q>  said Jesus. She turned around, and exclaimed in Hebrew, “Rabboni!” (or, as we should say, ‘teacher’).

<verse sID="John.20.17" osisID="John.20.17" n="17" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Do not hold me,”</q>  Jesus said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“for I have not yet ascended to the Father.

<verse eID="John.20.17" />
<verse sID="John.20.18" osisID="John.20.18" n="18" />Mary of Magdala went and told the disciples that she had seen the Master, and that he had said this to her.
<verse eID="John.20.18" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.20.19" osisID="John.20.19" n="19" />In the evening of the same day – the first day of the week – after the doors of the room, in which the disciples were, had been shut because they were afraid of the religious authorities, Jesus came and stood among them and said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Peace be with you”;</q>
<verse eID="John.20.19" />
<verse sID="John.20.20" osisID="John.20.20" n="20" />after which he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples were filled with joy when they saw the Master.
<verse eID="John.20.20" />
<verse sID="John.20.21" osisID="John.20.21" n="21" />Again Jesus said to them, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me as his messenger, so I am sending you.”</q>
<verse eID="John.20.21" />
<verse sID="John.20.22" osisID="John.20.22" n="22" />After saying this, he breathed on them, and said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Receive the Holy Spirit;</q>

<verse eID="John.20.24" />
<verse sID="John.20.25" osisID="John.20.25" n="25" />so the rest of the disciples said to him, “We have seen the Master!”
</p>
<p>
“Unless I see the marks of the nails in his hands,” he exclaimed, “and put my finger into the marks, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe it.”
<verse eID="John.20.25" />
<verse sID="John.20.26" osisID="John.20.26" n="26" />A week later the disciples were again in the house, and Thomas with them. After the doors had been shut, Jesus came and stood among them, and said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Peace be with you.”</q>
<verse eID="John.20.26" />

<verse sID="John.20.31" osisID="John.20.31" n="31" />but these have been recorded so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God – and that, through your belief in his name, you may have life.

<p>
<chapter sID="John.21" osisID="John.21" n="21" />
<verse sID="John.21.1" osisID="John.21.1" n="1" />Later on, Jesus showed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias.
<verse eID="John.21.1" />
<verse sID="John.21.2" osisID="John.21.2" n="2" />It was in this way, – Simon Peter, Thomas, who was called ‘The Twin,’ Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, Zebedee’s sons, and two other disciples of Jesus, were together, when Simon Peter said,
<verse eID="John.21.2" />
<verse sID="John.21.3" osisID="John.21.3" n="3" />“I am going fishing.”
</p>
<p>
“We will come with you,” said the others. They went out and got into the boat, but caught nothing that night.
<verse eID="John.21.3" />
<verse sID="John.21.4" osisID="John.21.4" n="4" />Just as day was breaking, Jesus came and stood on the beach; but the disciples did not know that it was he.
<verse eID="John.21.4" />
<verse sID="John.21.5" osisID="John.21.5" n="5" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“My children,”</q>  he said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“have you anything to eat?”</q>
</p>
<p>
“No,” they answered.
<verse eID="John.21.5" />
<verse sID="John.21.6" osisID="John.21.6" n="6" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Cast your net to the right of the boat,”</q>  he said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“and you will find fish.”</q>  So they cast the net, and now they could not haul it in because of the quantity of fish.
<verse eID="John.21.6" />
<verse sID="John.21.7" osisID="John.21.7" n="7" />The disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Master!” When Simon Peter heard that it was the Master, he fastened his coat around him (for he had taken it off), and threw himself into the sea.
<verse eID="John.21.7" />
<verse sID="John.21.8" osisID="John.21.8" n="8" />But the rest of the disciples came in the boat (for they were only about a hundred yards from shore), dragging the net full of fish.
<verse eID="John.21.8" />
<verse sID="John.21.9" osisID="John.21.9" n="9" />When they had come ashore, they found a charcoal fire ready, with some fish already on it, and some bread as well.
<verse eID="John.21.9" />
<verse sID="John.21.10" osisID="John.21.10" n="10" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Bring some of the fish which you have just caught,”</q>  said Jesus.
<verse eID="John.21.10" />
<verse sID="John.21.11" osisID="John.21.11" n="11" />So Simon Peter got into the boat and hauled the net ashore full of large fish, a hundred and fifty-three of them; and yet, although there were so many, the net had not been torn.
<verse eID="John.21.11" />
<verse sID="John.21.12" osisID="John.21.12" n="12" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Come and have breakfast.”</q> , Jesus said. None of the disciples dared ask him who he was, because they knew it was the Master.
<verse eID="John.21.12" />
<verse sID="John.21.13" osisID="John.21.13" n="13" />Jesus went and took the bread and gave it to them, and the fish too.
<verse eID="John.21.13" />
<verse sID="John.21.14" osisID="John.21.14" n="14" />This was the third time that Jesus showed himself to the disciples after he had risen from the dead.
<verse eID="John.21.14" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.21.15" osisID="John.21.15" n="15" />When breakfast was over, Jesus said to Simon Peter, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Simon, son of John, do you love me more than the others?”</q>
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Master,” he answered, “you know that I am your friend.”
</p>
<p>
<q who="Jesus" marker="">“Feed my lambs,”</q>  said Jesus.
<verse eID="John.21.15" />
<verse sID="John.21.16" osisID="John.21.16" n="16" />Then, a second time, Jesus asked, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Simon, son of John, do you love me?”</q>
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Master,” he answered, “you know that I am your friend.”
</p>
<p>
<q who="Jesus" marker="">“Tend my sheep,”</q>  said Jesus.
<verse eID="John.21.16" />
<verse sID="John.21.17" osisID="John.21.17" n="17" />The third time, Jesus said to him, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Simon, son of John, are you my friend?”</q>  Peter was hurt at his third question being ‘Are you my friend?’; and exclaimed, “Master, you know everything! You can tell that I am your friend.”
</p>
<p>
<q who="Jesus" marker="">“Feed my sheep,”</q>  said Jesus.
<verse eID="John.21.17" />
<verse sID="John.21.18" osisID="John.21.18" n="18" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“In truth I tell you,” he continued, “when you were young, you used to put on your own clothes, and walk wherever you wished; but, when you have grown old, you will have to stretch out your hands, while someone else puts on your clothes, and takes you where you do not wish.”</q>
<verse eID="John.21.18" />
<verse sID="John.21.19" osisID="John.21.19" n="19" />Jesus said this to show the death by which Peter was to honor God, and then he added, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Follow me.”</q>
<verse eID="John.21.19" />
<verse sID="John.21.20" osisID="John.21.20" n="20" />Peter turned around, and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following – the one who at the supper leant back on the Master’s shoulder, and asked him who it was who would betray him.
<verse eID="John.21.20" />
<verse sID="John.21.21" osisID="John.21.21" n="21" />Seeing him, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, what about this man?”
<verse eID="John.21.21" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.21.22" osisID="John.21.22" n="22" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“If it is my will that he should wait until I come,”</q>  answered Jesus, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“what has that to do with you? Follow me yourself.”</q>
<verse eID="John.21.22" />
<verse sID="John.21.23" osisID="John.21.23" n="23" />So the report spread among his followers that that disciple was not to die; yet Jesus did not say that he was not to die, but said <q who="Jesus" marker="">“If it is my will that he should wait until I come, what has that to do with you?”</q>
<verse eID="John.21.23" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.21.24" osisID="John.21.24" n="24" />It is this disciple who states these things, and who recorded them; and we know that his statement is true.
<verse eID="John.21.24" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="John.21.25" osisID="John.21.25" n="25" />There are many other things which Jesus did; but, if every one of them were to be recorded in detail, I suppose that even the world itself would not hold the books that would be written.

<p>
The first account which I drew up, Theophilus, dealt with all that Jesus did and taught from the very first,
<verse eID="Acts.1.1" />
<verse sID="Acts.1.2" osisID="Acts.1.2" n="2" />down to that day on which he was taken up to heaven, after he had, by the help of the Holy Spirit, given instructions to the apostles whom he had chosen.
<verse eID="Acts.1.2" />
<verse sID="Acts.1.3" osisID="Acts.1.3" n="3" />With abundant proofs, he showed himself to them, still living, after his death; appearing to them from time to time during forty days, and speaking of all that related to the kingdom of God.
<verse eID="Acts.1.3" />
<verse sID="Acts.1.4" osisID="Acts.1.4" n="4" />And once, when he had gathered them together, he charged them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait there for the fulfillment of the Father’s promise – <q who="Jesus" marker="">“that promise,”</q>  he said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“of which you have heard me speak;</q>
<verse eID="Acts.1.4" />
<verse sID="Acts.1.5" osisID="Acts.1.5" n="5" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">for, while John baptized with water, you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit before many days have passed.”</q>
<verse eID="Acts.1.5" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.1.6" osisID="Acts.1.6" n="6" />So, when the apostles had met together, they asked Jesus this question – “Master, is this the time when you intend to re-establish the kingdom for Israel?”
<verse eID="Acts.1.6" />
<verse sID="Acts.1.7" osisID="Acts.1.7" n="7" />His answer was, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“It is not for you to know times or hours, for the Father has reserved these for his own decision;</q>
<verse eID="Acts.1.7" />
<verse sID="Acts.1.8" osisID="Acts.1.8" n="8" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">but you will receive power, when the Holy Spirit will have descended on you, and will be witnesses for me not only in Jerusalem, but throughout Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.”</q>
<verse eID="Acts.1.8" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.1.9" osisID="Acts.1.9" n="9" />No sooner had Jesus said this than he was caught up before their eyes, and a cloud received him from their sight.
<verse eID="Acts.1.9" />
<verse sID="Acts.1.10" osisID="Acts.1.10" n="10" />While they were still gazing up into the heavens, as he went, suddenly two men, clothed in white, stood beside them,
<verse eID="Acts.1.10" />
<verse sID="Acts.1.11" osisID="Acts.1.11" n="11" />and said, “People of Galilee, why are you standing here looking up into the heavens? This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into the heavens, will come in the same way in which you have seen him go into the heavens.”
<verse eID="Acts.1.11" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.1.12" osisID="Acts.1.12" n="12" />Then the apostles returned to Jerusalem from the hill called Olivet, which is about three quarters of a mile from the city.
<verse eID="Acts.1.12" />
<verse sID="Acts.1.13" osisID="Acts.1.13" n="13" />When they reached Jerusalem, they went to the upstairs room, where they were staying. There were there Peter, John, James, and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James.
<verse eID="Acts.1.13" />
<verse sID="Acts.1.14" osisID="Acts.1.14" n="14" />They all united in devoting themselves to prayer, and so did some women, and Mary, the mother of Jesus, and his brothers.
<verse eID="Acts.1.14" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.1.15" osisID="Acts.1.15" n="15" />About this time, at a meeting of the Lord’s followers, when there were about a hundred and twenty present, Peter rose to speak.
<verse eID="Acts.1.15" />
<verse sID="Acts.1.16" osisID="Acts.1.16" n="16" />“Friends,” he said, “it was necessary that the prediction of scripture should be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit made by the lips of David about Judas, who acted as guide to the men who arrested Jesus,
<verse eID="Acts.1.16" />
<verse sID="Acts.1.17" osisID="Acts.1.17" n="17" />for he was one of our number and had his part allotted him in this work of ours.”
<verse eID="Acts.1.17" />
<verse sID="Acts.1.18" osisID="Acts.1.18" n="18" />(This man had bought a piece of land with the price of his treachery; and, falling heavily, his body had burst open, and all his bowels protruded.
<verse eID="Acts.1.18" />
<verse sID="Acts.1.19" osisID="Acts.1.19" n="19" />This became known to everyone living in Jerusalem, so that the field came to be called, in their language, ‘Akeldama,’ which means the ‘Field of Blood.’)
<verse eID="Acts.1.19" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.1.20" osisID="Acts.1.20" n="20" />“For in the book of Psalms,” Peter continued, “it is said –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘Let his home become desolate,</l>
<l level="2">and let no one live in it’; </l>
</lg>
<lb type="x-p" />
<p type="x-noindent">
and also –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘His office let another take.’ <verse eID="Acts.1.20" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Acts.1.21" osisID="Acts.1.21" n="21" />Therefore, from among the men who have been with us all the time that Jesus, our Master, went in and out among us –
<verse eID="Acts.1.21" />
<verse sID="Acts.1.22" osisID="Acts.1.22" n="22" />from his baptism by John down to that day on which he was taken from us – someone must be found to join us as a witness of his resurrection.”
<verse eID="Acts.1.22" />
<verse sID="Acts.1.23" osisID="Acts.1.23" n="23" />So they put forward two men, Joseph called Barsabbas, whose other name was Justus, and Matthias;
<verse eID="Acts.1.23" />
<verse sID="Acts.1.24" osisID="Acts.1.24" n="24" />and they offered this prayer –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">“Lord, who reads all hearts, show which of these two men you have chosen
<verse eID="Acts.1.24" />
<verse sID="Acts.1.25" osisID="Acts.1.25" n="25" />to take the place in this apostolic work, which Judas has abandoned, to go to his proper place.” <verse eID="Acts.1.25" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Acts.1.26" osisID="Acts.1.26" n="26" />Then they drew lots between them; and, the lot having fallen to Matthias, he was added to the number of the eleven apostles.
<verse eID="Acts.1.26" />
<chapter eID="Acts.1" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Acts.2" osisID="Acts.2" n="2" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.1" osisID="Acts.2.1" n="1" />In the course of the Festival at the close of the Harvest the disciples had all met together,
<verse eID="Acts.2.1" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.2" osisID="Acts.2.2" n="2" />when suddenly there came from the heavens a noise like a strong wind rushing by; it filled the whole house in which they were sitting.
<verse eID="Acts.2.2" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.3" osisID="Acts.2.3" n="3" />Then there appeared tongues of what seemed to be flame, separating, so that one settled on each of them;
<verse eID="Acts.2.3" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.4" osisID="Acts.2.4" n="4" />and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak in different languages as the Spirit prompted their utterances.
<verse eID="Acts.2.4" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.2.5" osisID="Acts.2.5" n="5" />Now there were then staying in Jerusalem religious Jews from every country in the world;
<verse eID="Acts.2.5" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.6" osisID="Acts.2.6" n="6" />and, when this sound was heard, numbers of people collected, in the greatest excitement, because each of them heard the disciples speaking in his own language.
<verse eID="Acts.2.6" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.7" osisID="Acts.2.7" n="7" />They were utterly amazed, and kept asking in astonishment, “What! Are not all these people who are speaking Galileans?
<verse eID="Acts.2.7" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.8" osisID="Acts.2.8" n="8" />Then how is it that we each of us hear them in our own language?
<verse eID="Acts.2.8" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.9" osisID="Acts.2.9" n="9" />Some of us are Parthians, some Medes, some Elamites; and some of us live in Mesopotamia, in Judea and Cappadocia, in Pontus and Roman Asia,
<verse eID="Acts.2.9" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.10" osisID="Acts.2.10" n="10" />in Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt and the districts of Libya adjoining Cyrene; some of us are visitors from Rome,
<verse eID="Acts.2.10" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.11" osisID="Acts.2.11" n="11" />either Jews by birth or converts, and some are Cretans and Arabians – yet we all alike hear them speaking in our own languages of the great things that God has done.”
<verse eID="Acts.2.11" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.12" osisID="Acts.2.12" n="12" />They were all utterly amazed and bewildered.
</p>
<p>
“What does it mean?” they asked one another.
<verse eID="Acts.2.12" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.13" osisID="Acts.2.13" n="13" />But there were some who said with a sneer, “They have had too much new wine.”
<verse eID="Acts.2.13" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.2.14" osisID="Acts.2.14" n="14" />Then Peter, surrounded by the eleven other apostles, stood up, and, raising his voice, addressed the crowd. “People of Judea,” he began, “and all you who are staying in Jerusalem, let me tell you what this means. Mark well my words.
<verse eID="Acts.2.14" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.15" osisID="Acts.2.15" n="15" />These people are not drunk, as you suppose; for it is only now nine in the morning! No!
<verse eID="Acts.2.15" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.16" osisID="Acts.2.16" n="16" />This is what is spoken of in the prophet Joel –
<verse eID="Acts.2.16" />
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">
<verse sID="Acts.2.17" osisID="Acts.2.17" n="17" />‘It will come about in the last days,’ God says,</l>

<l level="1">your sons and your daughters will become prophets,</l>

<l level="2">
<verse sID="Acts.2.18" osisID="Acts.2.18" n="18" />yes, even on the slaves – for they are mine – both men and women,</l>
<l level="2">I will in those days pour out my Spirit,</l>
<l level="3">and they will become prophets; <verse eID="Acts.2.18" /></l>
<l level="1">
<verse sID="Acts.2.19" osisID="Acts.2.19" n="19" />and I will show wonders in the heavens above,</l>
<l level="1">and signs on the earth below –</l>
<l level="2">blood and fire and mist of smoke; <verse eID="Acts.2.19" /></l>
<l level="1">
<verse sID="Acts.2.20" osisID="Acts.2.20" n="20" />the sun will become darkness,</l>
<l level="1">and the moon blood-red,</l>
<l level="2">before the day of the Lord comes – that great and awful day. <verse eID="Acts.2.20" /></l>
<l level="3">
<verse sID="Acts.2.21" osisID="Acts.2.21" n="21" />Then will everyone who invokes the name of the Lord be saved.’ <verse eID="Acts.2.21" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Acts.2.22" osisID="Acts.2.22" n="22" />People of Israel, listen to what I am saying. Jesus of Nazareth, a man whose mission from God to you was proved by miracles, wonders, and signs, which God showed among you through him, as you know full well –
<verse eID="Acts.2.22" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.23" osisID="Acts.2.23" n="23" />He, I say, in accordance with God’s definite plan and with his previous knowledge, was betrayed, and you, by the hands of lawless men, nailed him to a cross and put him to death.
<verse eID="Acts.2.23" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.24" osisID="Acts.2.24" n="24" />But God released him from the pangs of death and raised him to life, it being impossible for death to retain its hold on him.
<verse eID="Acts.2.24" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.25" osisID="Acts.2.25" n="25" />Indeed he was the one David was referring to when he said –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘I have had the Lord ever before my eyes,</l>
<l level="2">for he stands at my right hand, so that I should not be disquieted. <verse eID="Acts.2.25" /></l>
<l level="1">
<verse sID="Acts.2.26" osisID="Acts.2.26" n="26" />Therefore my heart was cheered, and my tongue told its delight;</l>
<l level="2">yes, even my body, too, will rest in hope; <verse eID="Acts.2.26" /></l>
<l level="1">
<verse sID="Acts.2.27" osisID="Acts.2.27" n="27" />For you will not abandon my soul to Hades,</l>
<l level="2">nor surrender me, your holy one, to undergo corruption. <verse eID="Acts.2.27" /></l>
<l level="1">
<verse sID="Acts.2.28" osisID="Acts.2.28" n="28" />You have shown me the path to life,</l>
<l level="2">you will fill me with gladness in your presence.’ <verse eID="Acts.2.28" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Acts.2.29" osisID="Acts.2.29" n="29" />Friends, I can speak to you the more confidently about the patriarch David, because he is dead and buried, and his tomb is here among us to this very day.
<verse eID="Acts.2.29" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.30" osisID="Acts.2.30" n="30" />David, then, prophet as he was, knowing that God had solemnly sworn to him to set one of his descendants on his throne, looked into the future,
<verse eID="Acts.2.30" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.31" osisID="Acts.2.31" n="31" />and referred to the resurrection of the Christ when he said that he had not been abandoned to Hades, nor had his body undergone corruption.
<verse eID="Acts.2.31" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.32" osisID="Acts.2.32" n="32" />It was this Jesus, whom God raised to life; and of that we are ourselves all witnesses.
<verse eID="Acts.2.32" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.33" osisID="Acts.2.33" n="33" />And now that he has been exalted to the right hand of God, and has received from the Father the promised gift of the Holy Spirit, he has begun to pour out that gift, as you yourselves now see and hear.
<verse eID="Acts.2.33" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.34" osisID="Acts.2.34" n="34" />It was not David who went up into heaven; for he himself says –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘The Lord said to my master, “Sit on my right hand, <verse eID="Acts.2.34" /></l>
<l level="1">
<verse sID="Acts.2.35" osisID="Acts.2.35" n="35" />Until I put your enemies as a footstool under your feet.”’ <verse eID="Acts.2.35" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Acts.2.36" osisID="Acts.2.36" n="36" />So let the whole nation of Israel know beyond all doubt, that God has made him both Lord and Christ – this Jesus whom you crucified.”
<verse eID="Acts.2.36" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.2.37" osisID="Acts.2.37" n="37" />When the people heard this, they were conscience-smitten, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, “Friends, what can we do?”
<verse eID="Acts.2.37" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.2.38" osisID="Acts.2.38" n="38" />“Repent,” answered Peter, “and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and then you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
<verse eID="Acts.2.38" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.39" osisID="Acts.2.39" n="39" />For the promise is for you and for your children, and also for all those now far away, who may be called by the Lord our God.”
<verse eID="Acts.2.39" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.2.40" osisID="Acts.2.40" n="40" />Peter spoke to them for a long time using many other arguments and pleaded with them – “Save yourselves from the perverse spirit of this age.”
<verse eID="Acts.2.40" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.41" osisID="Acts.2.41" n="41" />So those who accepted his teaching were baptized, and about three thousand people joined the disciples on that day alone.
<verse eID="Acts.2.41" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.42" osisID="Acts.2.42" n="42" />They devoted themselves to the teaching of the apostles and to the Common life of the church, to the breaking of the bread and to the Prayers.
<verse eID="Acts.2.42" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.2.43" osisID="Acts.2.43" n="43" />A deep impression was made on everyone, and many wonders and signs were done at the hands of the apostles.
<verse eID="Acts.2.43" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.44" osisID="Acts.2.44" n="44" />All who became believers in Christ held everything for the common use;
<verse eID="Acts.2.44" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.45" osisID="Acts.2.45" n="45" />they sold their property and their goods, and shared the proceeds among them all, according to their individual needs.
<verse eID="Acts.2.45" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.46" osisID="Acts.2.46" n="46" />Every day they devoted themselves to meeting together in the Temple Courts, and to the breaking of bread at their homes, while they partook of their food in simple-hearted gladness, praising God, and winning the goodwill of all the people.
<verse eID="Acts.2.46" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.47" osisID="Acts.2.47" n="47" />And the Lord daily added to their company those who were in the path of salvation.
<verse eID="Acts.2.47" />
<chapter eID="Acts.2" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Acts.3" osisID="Acts.3" n="3" />
<verse sID="Acts.3.1" osisID="Acts.3.1" n="1" />One day, as Peter and John were going up into the Temple Courts for the three o’clock Prayers, a man, who had been lame from his birth, was being carried by.
<verse eID="Acts.3.1" />
<verse sID="Acts.3.2" osisID="Acts.3.2" n="2" />This man used to be set down every day at the gate of the Temple called ‘the Beautiful Gate,’ to beg of those who went in.
<verse eID="Acts.3.2" />
<verse sID="Acts.3.3" osisID="Acts.3.3" n="3" />Seeing Peter and John on the point of entering, he asked them to give him something.
<verse eID="Acts.3.3" />
<verse sID="Acts.3.4" osisID="Acts.3.4" n="4" />Peter fixed his eyes on him, and so did John, and then Peter said, “Look at us.”
<verse eID="Acts.3.4" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.3.5" osisID="Acts.3.5" n="5" />The man was all attention, expecting to get something from them;
<verse eID="Acts.3.5" />
<verse sID="Acts.3.6" osisID="Acts.3.6" n="6" />but Peter added, “I have no gold or silver, but I give you what I have. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, get up and walk.”
<verse eID="Acts.3.6" />
<verse sID="Acts.3.7" osisID="Acts.3.7" n="7" />Grasping the lame man by the right hand, Peter lifted him up. Instantly the man’s feet and ankles became strong,
<verse eID="Acts.3.7" />
<verse sID="Acts.3.8" osisID="Acts.3.8" n="8" />and, leaping up, he stood and began to walk about, and then went with them into the Temple Courts, walking, and leaping, and praising God.
<verse eID="Acts.3.8" />
<verse sID="Acts.3.9" osisID="Acts.3.9" n="9" />All the people saw him walking about and praising God;
<verse eID="Acts.3.9" />
<verse sID="Acts.3.10" osisID="Acts.3.10" n="10" />and, when they recognized him as the man who used to sit begging at the Beautiful Gate of the Temple, they were utterly astonished and amazed at what had happened to him.
<verse eID="Acts.3.10" />
<verse sID="Acts.3.11" osisID="Acts.3.11" n="11" />While the man still clung to Peter and John, the people all quickly gathered around them in the Colonnade named after Solomon, in the greatest astonishment.
<verse eID="Acts.3.11" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.3.12" osisID="Acts.3.12" n="12" />On seeing this, Peter said to the people, “People of Israel, why are you surprised at this? And why do you stare at us, as though we, by any power or piety of our own, had enabled this man to walk?
<verse eID="Acts.3.12" />
<verse sID="Acts.3.13" osisID="Acts.3.13" n="13" />The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our ancestors, has done honor to his servant Jesus – him whom you gave up and disowned before Pilate, when he had decided to set him free.
<verse eID="Acts.3.13" />
<verse sID="Acts.3.14" osisID="Acts.3.14" n="14" />You, I say, disowned the holy and righteous one, and asked for the release of a murderer!
<verse eID="Acts.3.14" />
<verse sID="Acts.3.15" osisID="Acts.3.15" n="15" />The guide to life you put to death! But God raised him from the dead – and of that we are ourselves witnesses.
<verse eID="Acts.3.15" />
<verse sID="Acts.3.16" osisID="Acts.3.16" n="16" />And it is by faith in the name of Jesus, that this man, whom you all see and know, has – by his name – been made strong. Yes, it is the faith inspired by Jesus that has made this complete cure of the man, before the eyes of you all.
<verse eID="Acts.3.16" />
<verse sID="Acts.3.17" osisID="Acts.3.17" n="17" />And yet, my friends, I know that you acted as you did from ignorance, and your rulers also.
<verse eID="Acts.3.17" />
<verse sID="Acts.3.18" osisID="Acts.3.18" n="18" />But it was in this way that God fulfilled all that he had long ago foretold, as to the sufferings of his Christ, by the lips of all the prophets.
<verse eID="Acts.3.18" />
<verse sID="Acts.3.19" osisID="Acts.3.19" n="19" />Therefore, repent and turn so that your sins may be wiped away; so that happier times may come from the Lord himself,
<verse eID="Acts.3.19" />
<verse sID="Acts.3.20" osisID="Acts.3.20" n="20" />and so that he may send you, in Jesus, your long-appointed Christ.
<verse eID="Acts.3.20" />
<verse sID="Acts.3.21" osisID="Acts.3.21" n="21" />But heaven must be his home, until the days of the Universal Restoration, of which God has spoken by the lips of his holy prophets from the very first.
<verse eID="Acts.3.21" />
<verse sID="Acts.3.22" osisID="Acts.3.22" n="22" />Moses himself said –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘The Lord your God will raise up from among yourselves a prophet, as he raised me. To him you will listen whenever he speaks to you.
<verse eID="Acts.3.22" />
<verse sID="Acts.3.23" osisID="Acts.3.23" n="23" />And it will be that should anyone among the people not listen to that prophet, he will be utterly destroyed.’ <verse eID="Acts.3.23" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Acts.3.24" osisID="Acts.3.24" n="24" />Yes, and all the prophets from Samuel onwards, and all their successors who had a message to deliver, told of these days.
<verse eID="Acts.3.24" />
<verse sID="Acts.3.25" osisID="Acts.3.25" n="25" />You yourselves are the heirs of the prophets, and heirs, too, of the covenant which God made with your ancestors, when he said to Abraham –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘In your descendants will all the nations of the earth be blessed.’ <verse eID="Acts.3.25" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Acts.3.26" osisID="Acts.3.26" n="26" />For you, first, God raised up his servant, and sent him to bless you, by turning each one of you from his wicked ways.”

<chapter eID="Acts.3" />
<chapter sID="Acts.4" osisID="Acts.4" n="4" />
<verse sID="Acts.4.1" osisID="Acts.4.1" n="1" />While Peter and John were still speaking to the people, the chief priest, with the officer in charge at the Temple and the Sadducees, came up to them,
<verse eID="Acts.4.1" />
<verse sID="Acts.4.2" osisID="Acts.4.2" n="2" />much annoyed because they were teaching the people, and because, through Jesus, they were preaching the resurrection from the dead.
<verse eID="Acts.4.2" />
<verse sID="Acts.4.3" osisID="Acts.4.3" n="3" />They arrested the apostles and, as it was already evening, had them placed in custody until the next day.
<verse eID="Acts.4.3" />
<verse sID="Acts.4.4" osisID="Acts.4.4" n="4" />Many, however, of those who had heard the apostles’ message became believers in Christ, the number of the men alone amounting to about five thousand.
<verse eID="Acts.4.4" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.4.5" osisID="Acts.4.5" n="5" />The next day, a meeting of the leaders of the people, the elders, and the teachers of the Law was held in Jerusalem.
<verse eID="Acts.4.5" />
<verse sID="Acts.4.6" osisID="Acts.4.6" n="6" />There were present Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and all who were of High-Priestly rank.
<verse eID="Acts.4.6" />
<verse sID="Acts.4.7" osisID="Acts.4.7" n="7" />They had Peter and John brought before them, and questioned them.
</p>
<p>
“By what power,” they asked, “Or in whose name have men like you done this thing?”
<verse eID="Acts.4.7" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.4.8" osisID="Acts.4.8" n="8" />Then, Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said, “Leaders of the people and elders,
<verse eID="Acts.4.8" />
<verse sID="Acts.4.9" osisID="Acts.4.9" n="9" />since we are on our trial today for a kind act done to a helpless man, and are asked in what way the man here before you has been cured,
<verse eID="Acts.4.9" />
<verse sID="Acts.4.10" osisID="Acts.4.10" n="10" />let me tell you all and all the people of Israel, that it is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified and whom God raised from the dead – it is, I say, by his name that this man stands here before you lame no longer.
<verse eID="Acts.4.10" />
<verse sID="Acts.4.11" osisID="Acts.4.11" n="11" />Jesus is ‘the stone which, scorned by you the builders, has yet become the corner stone.’
<verse eID="Acts.4.11" />
<verse sID="Acts.4.12" osisID="Acts.4.12" n="12" />And salvation is in him alone; for there is no other name in the whole world, given to people, to which we must look for our salvation.”
<verse eID="Acts.4.12" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.4.13" osisID="Acts.4.13" n="13" />When the Council saw how boldly Peter and John spoke, and found that they were uneducated men of humble station, they were surprised, and realized that they had been companions of Jesus.
<verse eID="Acts.4.13" />
<verse sID="Acts.4.14" osisID="Acts.4.14" n="14" />But, when they looked at the man who had been healed, standing there with them, they had nothing to say.
<verse eID="Acts.4.14" />
<verse sID="Acts.4.15" osisID="Acts.4.15" n="15" />So they ordered them out of court, and then began consulting together.
<verse eID="Acts.4.15" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.4.16" osisID="Acts.4.16" n="16" />“What are we to do to these men?” they asked one another. “That a remarkable sign has been given through them is obvious to everyone living in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.
<verse eID="Acts.4.16" />
<verse sID="Acts.4.17" osisID="Acts.4.17" n="17" />But, to prevent this thing from spreading further among the people, let us warn them not to speak in this name any more to anyone whatever.”
<verse eID="Acts.4.17" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.4.18" osisID="Acts.4.18" n="18" />So they called the apostles in, and ordered them not to speak or teach in the name of Jesus.
<verse eID="Acts.4.18" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.4.19" osisID="Acts.4.19" n="19" />But Peter and John replied, “Whether it is right, in the sight of God, to listen to you rather than to him –
<verse eID="Acts.4.19" />
<verse sID="Acts.4.20" osisID="Acts.4.20" n="20" />judge for yourselves, for we cannot help speaking of what we have seen and heard.”
<verse eID="Acts.4.20" />
<verse sID="Acts.4.21" osisID="Acts.4.21" n="21" />However, after further warnings, the Council set them at liberty, not seeing any safe way of punishing them, because of the people, for they were all praising God for what had occurred;
<verse eID="Acts.4.21" />
<verse sID="Acts.4.22" osisID="Acts.4.22" n="22" />for the man who was the subject of this miraculous cure was more than forty years old.
<verse eID="Acts.4.22" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.4.23" osisID="Acts.4.23" n="23" />After they had been set at liberty, the apostles went to their friends and told them what the chief priests and the elders had said to them.
<verse eID="Acts.4.23" />
<verse sID="Acts.4.24" osisID="Acts.4.24" n="24" />All who heard their story, moved by a common impulse, raised their voices to God in prayer:
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">“Sovereign Lord, it is you who has made the heavens, the earth, the sea, and everything that is in them,
<verse eID="Acts.4.24" />
<verse sID="Acts.4.25" osisID="Acts.4.25" n="25" />and who, by the lips of our ancestor, your servant David, who spoke under the influence of the Holy Spirit, have said –</l>
<l level="2">‘Why did the nations rage,</l>
<l level="3">and the peoples form vain designs? <verse eID="Acts.4.25" /></l>
<l level="2">
<verse sID="Acts.4.26" osisID="Acts.4.26" n="26" />The kings of the earth set their array,</l>
<l level="2">and its rulers gathered together,</l>
<l level="3">against the Lord and against his Christ.’ <verse eID="Acts.4.26" /></l>
<l level="1">
<verse sID="Acts.4.27" osisID="Acts.4.27" n="27" />There have indeed gathered together in this city against your holy servant Jesus, whom you has consecrated the Christ, not Herod and Pontius Pilate only, but the nations and the people of Israel besides –
<verse eID="Acts.4.27" />
<verse sID="Acts.4.28" osisID="Acts.4.28" n="28" />Yet only to do what you, by your power and of your own will, did long ago destine to be done.
<verse eID="Acts.4.28" />
<verse sID="Acts.4.29" osisID="Acts.4.29" n="29" />Now, therefore, Lord, mark their threats, and enable your servants, with all fearlessness, to tell your message,
<verse eID="Acts.4.29" />
<verse sID="Acts.4.30" osisID="Acts.4.30" n="30" />while you stretch out your hand to heal, and cause signs and wonders to take place through the name of your holy servant Jesus.” <verse eID="Acts.4.30" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Acts.4.31" osisID="Acts.4.31" n="31" />When their prayer was ended, the place in which they were assembled was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to tell God’s message fearlessly.
<verse eID="Acts.4.31" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.4.32" osisID="Acts.4.32" n="32" />The whole body of those who had become believers in Christ were of one heart and mind. Not one of them claimed any of his goods as his own, but everything was held for the common use.
<verse eID="Acts.4.32" />
<verse sID="Acts.4.33" osisID="Acts.4.33" n="33" />The apostles continued with great power to bear their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and God’s blessing rested on them all abundantly.
<verse eID="Acts.4.33" />
<verse sID="Acts.4.34" osisID="Acts.4.34" n="34" />Nor was there anyone in need among them, for all who were owners of land or houses sold them, and brought the proceeds of the sales
<verse eID="Acts.4.34" />
<verse sID="Acts.4.35" osisID="Acts.4.35" n="35" />And laid them at the apostles’ feet; and then everyone received a share in proportion to his wants.
<verse eID="Acts.4.35" />
<verse sID="Acts.4.36" osisID="Acts.4.36" n="36" />A Levite of Cyprian birth, named Joseph, (who had received from the apostles the additional name of ‘Barnabas’ – which means ‘The Consoler,’)
<verse eID="Acts.4.36" />
<verse sID="Acts.4.37" osisID="Acts.4.37" n="37" />Sold a farm that belonged to him, and brought the money and laid it at the apostles’ feet.

</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Acts.5" osisID="Acts.5" n="5" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.1" osisID="Acts.5.1" n="1" />There was, however, a man named Ananias, who, with his wife Sapphira, sold some property,
<verse eID="Acts.5.1" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.2" osisID="Acts.5.2" n="2" />and, with her connivance, kept back some of the proceeds. He brought only a part and laid it at the apostles’ feet.
<verse eID="Acts.5.2" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.5.3" osisID="Acts.5.3" n="3" />“Ananias,” Peter exclaimed, “how is it that Satan has so taken possession of your heart that you have lied to the Holy Spirit, and kept back a part of the money paid for the land?
<verse eID="Acts.5.3" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.4" osisID="Acts.5.4" n="4" />While it was unsold, was not it your own? And after it was sold, was not the money at your own disposal? How did you come to think of such a thing? You have lied, not to people, but to God!”
<verse eID="Acts.5.4" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.5.5" osisID="Acts.5.5" n="5" />As Ananias heard these words, he fell down and expired; and everyone who heard of it was appalled.
<verse eID="Acts.5.5" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.6" osisID="Acts.5.6" n="6" />The young men got up, and, winding the body in a sheet, carried it out and buried it.
<verse eID="Acts.5.6" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.5.7" osisID="Acts.5.7" n="7" />After an interval of about three hours his wife came in, not knowing what had happened.
<verse eID="Acts.5.7" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.8" osisID="Acts.5.8" n="8" />“Is it true,” Peter asked, addressing her, “that you sold your land for such a sum?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” she answered, “we did.”
<verse eID="Acts.5.8" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.9" osisID="Acts.5.9" n="9" />Then Peter said, “How did you come to agree to provoke the Spirit of the Lord? Listen! The footsteps of those who have buried your husband are at the door; and they will carry you out too.”
<verse eID="Acts.5.9" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.5.10" osisID="Acts.5.10" n="10" />Instantly Sapphira fell down at Peter’s feet and expired. On coming in, the young men found her dead; so they carried her out and buried her by her husband’s side.
<verse eID="Acts.5.10" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.11" osisID="Acts.5.11" n="11" />The whole church and all who heard of these events were appalled.
<verse eID="Acts.5.11" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.5.12" osisID="Acts.5.12" n="12" />Many signs and wonders continued to occur among the people, through the instrumentality of the apostles, whose custom it was to meet all together in the Colonnade of Solomon;
<verse eID="Acts.5.12" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.13" osisID="Acts.5.13" n="13" />but of the rest no one ventured to join them. On the other hand, the people were full of their praise,
<verse eID="Acts.5.13" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.14" osisID="Acts.5.14" n="14" />and still larger numbers, both of men and women, as they became believers in the Lord, were added to their number.
<verse eID="Acts.5.14" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.15" osisID="Acts.5.15" n="15" />The consequence was that people would bring out their sick even into the streets, and lay them on mattresses and mats, in the hope that, as Peter came by, at least his shadow might fall on someone of them.
<verse eID="Acts.5.15" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.16" osisID="Acts.5.16" n="16" />Besides this, the inhabitants of the towns around Jerusalem flocked into the city, bringing with them their sick and those who were troubled by foul spirits; and they were cured everyone.
<verse eID="Acts.5.16" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.5.17" osisID="Acts.5.17" n="17" />At this the high priest was roused to action, and he and all his supporters (who formed the party of the Sadducees), moved by jealousy,
<verse eID="Acts.5.17" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.18" osisID="Acts.5.18" n="18" />arrested the apostles, and had them placed in custody.
<verse eID="Acts.5.18" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.19" osisID="Acts.5.19" n="19" />An angel of the Lord, however, opened the prison doors at night and led them out.
<verse eID="Acts.5.19" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.20" osisID="Acts.5.20" n="20" />“Go,” he said, “and stand in the Temple Courts, and tell the people the whole message of this new life.”
<verse eID="Acts.5.20" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.21" osisID="Acts.5.21" n="21" />When they heard this, they went at daybreak into the Temple Courts, and began to teach. The high priest and his party, on their arrival, summoned the High Council, including all the leaders of the people among the Israelites, and sent to the jail to fetch the apostles.
<verse eID="Acts.5.21" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.22" osisID="Acts.5.22" n="22" />But, when the officers got there, they did not find them in the prison; so they returned and reported that,
<verse eID="Acts.5.22" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.23" osisID="Acts.5.23" n="23" />while they had found the goal barred securely and the guards posted at the doors, yet, on opening them, they had not found anyone inside.
<verse eID="Acts.5.23" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.24" osisID="Acts.5.24" n="24" />When the officer in charge at the Temple and the chief priests heard their story, they were perplexed about the apostles and as to what all this would lead to.
<verse eID="Acts.5.24" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.25" osisID="Acts.5.25" n="25" />Presently, however, someone came and told them, that the men whom they had put in prison were actually standing in the Temple Courts, teaching the people.
<verse eID="Acts.5.25" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.26" osisID="Acts.5.26" n="26" />Then, the officer went with his men and fetched the apostles – without using violence, for they were afraid of being stoned by the people –
<verse eID="Acts.5.26" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.27" osisID="Acts.5.27" n="27" />And then brought them before the Council. The high priest demanded an explanation from them.
<verse eID="Acts.5.27" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.5.28" osisID="Acts.5.28" n="28" />“We gave you strict orders,” he said, “not to teach in this name. Yet you have actually flooded Jerusalem with your teaching, and you want to make us responsible for the death of this man.”
<verse eID="Acts.5.28" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.5.29" osisID="Acts.5.29" n="29" />To this Peter and the apostles replied, “We must obey God rather than people.
<verse eID="Acts.5.29" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.30" osisID="Acts.5.30" n="30" />The God of our ancestors raised Jesus, whom you put to death by hanging him on a cross.
<verse eID="Acts.5.30" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.31" osisID="Acts.5.31" n="31" />It is this Jesus whom God has exalted to his right hand, to be a guide and a Savior, to give Israel repentance and forgiveness of sins.
<verse eID="Acts.5.31" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.32" osisID="Acts.5.32" n="32" />And we are witness to the truth of this, and so is the Holy Spirit – the gift of God to those who obey him.”
<verse eID="Acts.5.32" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.5.33" osisID="Acts.5.33" n="33" />The members of the Council became frantic with rage on hearing this, and were for putting the apostles to death.
<verse eID="Acts.5.33" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.34" osisID="Acts.5.34" n="34" />But Gamaliel, a Pharisee, who was a Doctor of the Law and who was held in universal respect, rose in the Council, and directed that the men should be taken out of court for a little while.
<verse eID="Acts.5.34" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.5.35" osisID="Acts.5.35" n="35" />He then said, “People of Israel, take care as to what you intend to do with these men.
<verse eID="Acts.5.35" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.36" osisID="Acts.5.36" n="36" />For not long ago Theudas appeared, professing to be somebody, and was joined by a body of some four hundred men. But he was killed; and all his followers scattered and dwindled away.
<verse eID="Acts.5.36" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.37" osisID="Acts.5.37" n="37" />After him, Judas the Galilean appeared at the time of the census, and induced people to follow him; Yet he, too, perished and all his followers were dispersed.
<verse eID="Acts.5.37" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.38" osisID="Acts.5.38" n="38" />And, in this present case, my advice to you is not to interfere with these men, but to leave them alone, for, if their designs and their work are merely of human origin, they will come to an end;
<verse eID="Acts.5.38" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.39" osisID="Acts.5.39" n="39" />but, if they are of divine origin, you will be powerless to put an end to them – or else you may find yourselves fighting against God!”
<verse eID="Acts.5.39" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.5.40" osisID="Acts.5.40" n="40" />The Council followed his advice, and, calling the apostles in, had them flogged, and then, after cautioning them not to speak in the name of Jesus, set them free.
<verse eID="Acts.5.40" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.41" osisID="Acts.5.41" n="41" />But the apostles left the Council, rejoicing that they had been thought worthy to suffer disgrace for that name;
<verse eID="Acts.5.41" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.42" osisID="Acts.5.42" n="42" />and never for a single day, either in the Temple Courts or in private houses, did they cease to teach, or to tell the good news of Jesus, the Christ.
<verse eID="Acts.5.42" />
<chapter eID="Acts.5" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Acts.6" osisID="Acts.6" n="6" />
<verse sID="Acts.6.1" osisID="Acts.6.1" n="1" />About this time, when the number of the disciples was constantly increasing, complaints were made by the Greek speaking Jews against the Aramaic speaking Jews, that their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution.
<verse eID="Acts.6.1" />
<verse sID="Acts.6.2" osisID="Acts.6.2" n="2" />The Twelve, therefore, called together the general body of the disciples and said to them, “It is not well for us to see to the distribution at the tables and neglect God’s message.
<verse eID="Acts.6.2" />
<verse sID="Acts.6.3" osisID="Acts.6.3" n="3" />Therefore, friends, look for seven men of reputation among yourselves, wise and spiritually-minded men, and we will appoint them to attend to this matter;
<verse eID="Acts.6.3" />
<verse sID="Acts.6.4" osisID="Acts.6.4" n="4" />while we, for our part, will devote ourselves to prayer, and to the delivery of the message.”
<verse eID="Acts.6.4" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.6.5" osisID="Acts.6.5" n="5" />This proposal was unanimously agreed to; and the disciples chose Stephen – a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit – and Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicholas of Antioch, a former convert to Judaism;
<verse eID="Acts.6.5" />
<verse sID="Acts.6.6" osisID="Acts.6.6" n="6" />and they brought these men to the apostles, who, after praying, placed their hands on them.
<verse eID="Acts.6.6" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.6.7" osisID="Acts.6.7" n="7" />So God’s message spread, and the number of the disciples continued to increase rapidly in Jerusalem, and a large body of the priests accepted the faith.
<verse eID="Acts.6.7" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.6.8" osisID="Acts.6.8" n="8" />Meanwhile Stephen, divinely helped and strengthened, was showing great wonders and signs among the people.
<verse eID="Acts.6.8" />
<verse sID="Acts.6.9" osisID="Acts.6.9" n="9" />But some members of the Synagogue of the Freed Slaves (as it was called), Cyrenians, Alexandrians, and Visitors from Cilicia and Roman Asia, were roused to action and began disputing with Stephen;
<verse eID="Acts.6.9" />
<verse sID="Acts.6.10" osisID="Acts.6.10" n="10" />yet they were quite unable to withstand the wisdom and the inspiration with which he spoke.
<verse eID="Acts.6.10" />
<verse sID="Acts.6.11" osisID="Acts.6.11" n="11" />Then they induced some men to assert that they had heard Stephen saying blasphemous things against Moses, and against God;
<verse eID="Acts.6.11" />
<verse sID="Acts.6.12" osisID="Acts.6.12" n="12" />and they stirred up the people, as well as the elders and the teachers of the Law, and set on Stephen, and arrested him, and brought him before the High Council.
<verse eID="Acts.6.12" />
<verse sID="Acts.6.13" osisID="Acts.6.13" n="13" />There they produced witnesses who gave false evidence.
</p>
<p>
“This man,” they said, “is incessantly saying things against this Holy place and the Law;
<verse eID="Acts.6.13" />
<verse sID="Acts.6.14" osisID="Acts.6.14" n="14" />indeed, we have heard him declare that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place, and change the customs handed down to us by Moses.”
<verse eID="Acts.6.14" />
<verse sID="Acts.6.15" osisID="Acts.6.15" n="15" />The eyes of all the members of the Council were riveted on Stephen, and they saw his face looking like the face of an angel.
<verse eID="Acts.6.15" />
<chapter eID="Acts.6" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Acts.7" osisID="Acts.7" n="7" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.1" osisID="Acts.7.1" n="1" />Then the high priest asked, “Is this true?”
<verse eID="Acts.7.1" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.2" osisID="Acts.7.2" n="2" />Stephen replied, “Brothers and fathers, hear what I have to say. God, who manifests himself in the glory, appeared to our ancestor Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, and before he settled in Haran, and said to him –
<verse eID="Acts.7.2" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.3" osisID="Acts.7.3" n="3" />‘Leave your country and your people, and come into the country that I will show you.’
<verse eID="Acts.7.3" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.4" osisID="Acts.7.4" n="4" />And so Abraham left the country of the Chaldaeans and settled in Haran; and from there, after his father’s death, God caused him to migrate into this country, in which you are now living.
<verse eID="Acts.7.4" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.5" osisID="Acts.7.5" n="5" />God did not at that time give him any part of it, not even a foot of ground. But he promised to give him possession of it and his descendants after him, though at that time he had no child.
<verse eID="Acts.7.5" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.6" osisID="Acts.7.6" n="6" />God’s words were these – ‘Abraham’s descendants will live in a foreign country, where they will be enslaved and ill-treated for four hundred years.
<verse eID="Acts.7.6" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.7" osisID="Acts.7.7" n="7" />But I myself will judge the nation, to which they will be enslaved,’ God said, ‘and after that they will leave the country and worship me in this place.’
<verse eID="Acts.7.7" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.8" osisID="Acts.7.8" n="8" />Then God made with Abraham the covenant of circumcision; and under it Abraham became the father of Isaac, and circumcised him when he was eight days old; and Isaac became the father of Jacob; and Jacob of the Twelve Patriarchs.
<verse eID="Acts.7.8" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.9" osisID="Acts.7.9" n="9" />The Patriarchs, out of jealousy, sold Joseph into slavery in Egypt; but God was with him,
<verse eID="Acts.7.9" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.10" osisID="Acts.7.10" n="10" />and delivered him out of all his troubles, and enabled him to win favor and show wisdom before Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who appointed him Governor of Egypt and of his whole household.
<verse eID="Acts.7.10" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.11" osisID="Acts.7.11" n="11" />Then a famine spread over the whole of Egypt and Canaan, causing great distress, and our ancestors could find no food.
<verse eID="Acts.7.11" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.12" osisID="Acts.7.12" n="12" />Hearing, however, that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob sent our ancestors there on their first visit.
<verse eID="Acts.7.12" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.13" osisID="Acts.7.13" n="13" />In the course of their second visit, Joseph revealed himself to his brothers, and his family became known to Pharaoh.
<verse eID="Acts.7.13" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.14" osisID="Acts.7.14" n="14" />Then Joseph sent an urgent invitation to his father Jacob and to his relatives, seventy-five persons in all;
<verse eID="Acts.7.14" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.15" osisID="Acts.7.15" n="15" />and so Jacob went down into Egypt. There he died, and our ancestors also,
<verse eID="Acts.7.15" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.16" osisID="Acts.7.16" n="16" />and their bodies were removed to Shechem, and laid in the tomb which Abraham had bought for a sum of money from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.
<verse eID="Acts.7.16" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.17" osisID="Acts.7.17" n="17" />As the time drew near for the fulfillment of the promise which God had made to Abraham, the people increased largely in numbers in Egypt,
<verse eID="Acts.7.17" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.18" osisID="Acts.7.18" n="18" />until a new king, who knew nothing of Joseph, came to the throne.
<verse eID="Acts.7.18" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.19" osisID="Acts.7.19" n="19" />This king acted deceitfully towards our people and ill-treated our ancestors, making them abandon their own infants, so that they should not be reared.
<verse eID="Acts.7.19" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.20" osisID="Acts.7.20" n="20" />It was just at this time that Moses was born. He was an exceedingly beautiful child, and for three months was brought up in his own father’s house;
<verse eID="Acts.7.20" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.21" osisID="Acts.7.21" n="21" />and, when he was abandoned, the daughter of Pharaoh found him and brought him up as her own son.
<verse eID="Acts.7.21" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.22" osisID="Acts.7.22" n="22" />So Moses was educated in all the learning of the Egyptians, and proved his ability both by his words and actions.
<verse eID="Acts.7.22" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.23" osisID="Acts.7.23" n="23" />When he was in his fortieth year, he resolved to visit his fellow Israelites;
<verse eID="Acts.7.23" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.24" osisID="Acts.7.24" n="24" />and, seeing an Israelite ill-treated, he defended him, and avenged the man, who was being wronged, by striking down the Egyptian.
<verse eID="Acts.7.24" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.25" osisID="Acts.7.25" n="25" />He thought his own people would understand that God was using him to save them; but they failed to do so.
<verse eID="Acts.7.25" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.26" osisID="Acts.7.26" n="26" />The next day he again appeared on the scene, when some of them were fighting, and tried to make peace between them. ‘Men,’ he said, ‘you are brothers; how is it that you are ill-treating one another?’
<verse eID="Acts.7.26" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.27" osisID="Acts.7.27" n="27" />But the man who was ill-treating his fellow workman pushed Moses aside saying – ‘Who made you a ruler and judge over us?
<verse eID="Acts.7.27" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.28" osisID="Acts.7.28" n="28" />Do you mean to make away with me as you did yesterday with that Egyptian?’
<verse eID="Acts.7.28" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.29" osisID="Acts.7.29" n="29" />At these words Moses took to flight, and became an exile in Midian; and there he had two sons born to him.
<verse eID="Acts.7.29" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.30" osisID="Acts.7.30" n="30" />Forty years had passed when there appeared to him, in the desert of Mount Sinai, an angel in a flame of fire in a bush.
<verse eID="Acts.7.30" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.31" osisID="Acts.7.31" n="31" />When Moses saw it, he was astonished at the vision; but on his going nearer to look at it more closely, the voice of the Lord was heard to say –
<verse eID="Acts.7.31" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.32" osisID="Acts.7.32" n="32" />‘I am the God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.’ Moses trembled, and did not dare to look.
<verse eID="Acts.7.32" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.33" osisID="Acts.7.33" n="33" />Then the Lord said to him – ‘Take your sandals off your feet, for the spot where you are standing is holy ground.
<verse eID="Acts.7.33" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.34" osisID="Acts.7.34" n="34" />I have seen the oppression of my people who are in Egypt, and heard their groans, and I have come down to deliver them. Come now and I will send you into Egypt.’
<verse eID="Acts.7.34" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.35" osisID="Acts.7.35" n="35" />This same Moses, whom they had disowned with the words – ‘Who made you a ruler and a judge?’ was the man whom God sent to be both a ruler and a deliverer, under the guidance of the angel that had appeared to him in the bush.
<verse eID="Acts.7.35" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.36" osisID="Acts.7.36" n="36" />He it was who led them out, after he had shown wonders and signs in Egypt, in the Red Sea, and in the desert during forty years.
<verse eID="Acts.7.36" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.37" osisID="Acts.7.37" n="37" />This was the Moses who said to the people of Israel – ‘God will raise up for you, from among yourselves, a prophet, as he raised up me.’
<verse eID="Acts.7.37" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.38" osisID="Acts.7.38" n="38" />He, too, it was who was present at the assembly in the desert, with the angel who talked to him on Mount Sinai, and with our ancestors, and who received living truths to impart to you.
<verse eID="Acts.7.38" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.39" osisID="Acts.7.39" n="39" />Yet our ancestors refused him obedience; more than that, they rejected him, and in their hearts turned back to Egypt,
<verse eID="Acts.7.39" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.40" osisID="Acts.7.40" n="40" />while they said to Aaron – ‘Make us Gods who will lead the way for us, since, as for this Moses who has brought us out of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.’
<verse eID="Acts.7.40" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.41" osisID="Acts.7.41" n="41" />That was the time when they made the calf and offered sacrifice to their idol, and held festivities in honor of their own handiwork!
<verse eID="Acts.7.41" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.42" osisID="Acts.7.42" n="42" />So God turned from them and left them to the worship of the Starry Host, as is written in the book of the prophets –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘Did you offer victims and sacrifices to me, house of Israel,</l>
<l level="2">all those forty years in the desert? <verse eID="Acts.7.42" /></l>
<l level="1">
<verse sID="Acts.7.43" osisID="Acts.7.43" n="43" />You took with you the tent where Moloch is worshiped</l>
<l level="1">and the star of the god Rephan –</l>
<l level="2">the images which you had made to worship.</l>
<l level="3">Therefore I will exile you beyond Babylon.’ <verse eID="Acts.7.43" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Acts.7.44" osisID="Acts.7.44" n="44" />Our ancestors had the tent where they worshiped God in the desert, constructed, just as he who spoke to Moses had directed him to make it, after the model which he had seen.
<verse eID="Acts.7.44" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.45" osisID="Acts.7.45" n="45" />This tent, which was handed down to them, was brought into this country by our ancestors who accompanied Joshua (at the conquest of the nations that God drove out before their advance), and remained here until the time of David.
<verse eID="Acts.7.45" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.46" osisID="Acts.7.46" n="46" />David found favor with God, and prayed that he might provide the God of Jacob with a place to reside.
<verse eID="Acts.7.46" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.47" osisID="Acts.7.47" n="47" />But it was Solomon who built a house for God.
<verse eID="Acts.7.47" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.48" osisID="Acts.7.48" n="48" />Yet it is not in buildings made by hands that the Most High dwells. As the prophet says –
<verse eID="Acts.7.48" />
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">
<verse sID="Acts.7.49" osisID="Acts.7.49" n="49" />‘The heavens are a throne for me,</l>
<l level="2">and the earth a stool for my feet.</l>
<l level="1">What manner of house will you build me, asks the Lord,</l>
<l level="2">or what place is there where I may rest? <verse eID="Acts.7.49" /></l>
<l level="3">
<verse sID="Acts.7.50" osisID="Acts.7.50" n="50" />Was it not my hand that made all these things?’ <verse eID="Acts.7.50" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Acts.7.51" osisID="Acts.7.51" n="51" />Stubborn people, heathen in heart and ears, you are for ever resisting the Holy Spirit; your ancestors did it, and you are doing it still.
<verse eID="Acts.7.51" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.52" osisID="Acts.7.52" n="52" />Which of the prophets escaped persecution at their hands? They killed those who foretold the coming of the righteous one; of whom you, in your turn, have now become the betrayers and murderers –
<verse eID="Acts.7.52" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.53" osisID="Acts.7.53" n="53" />You who received the Law as transmitted by angels and yet failed to keep it.”
<verse eID="Acts.7.53" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.7.54" osisID="Acts.7.54" n="54" />As they listened to this, the Council grew frantic with rage, and gnashed their teeth at Stephen.
<verse eID="Acts.7.54" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.55" osisID="Acts.7.55" n="55" />He, filled as he was with the Holy Spirit, fixed his eyes intently on the heavens, and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at God’s right hand.
<verse eID="Acts.7.55" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.7.56" osisID="Acts.7.56" n="56" />“Look,” he exclaimed, “I see heaven open and the Son of Man standing at God’s right hand!”
<verse eID="Acts.7.56" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.57" osisID="Acts.7.57" n="57" />At this, with a loud shout, they stopped their ears and all rushed on him, forced him outside the city,
<verse eID="Acts.7.57" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.58" osisID="Acts.7.58" n="58" />and began to stone him, the witnesses laying their clothes at the feet of a young man named Saul.
<verse eID="Acts.7.58" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.59" osisID="Acts.7.59" n="59" />And they stoned Stephen, while he cried to the Lord, “Lord Jesus! Receive my spirit!”
<verse eID="Acts.7.59" />
<verse sID="Acts.7.60" osisID="Acts.7.60" n="60" />Falling on his knees, he called out loudly, “Lord! Do not charge them with this sin;” and with these words he fell asleep.

</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Acts.8" osisID="Acts.8" n="8" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.1" osisID="Acts.8.1" n="1" />Saul approved of his being put to death.
</p>
<p>
On that very day a great persecution broke out against the church which was in Jerusalem; and its members, with the exception of the apostles, were all scattered over the districts of Judea and Samaria.
<verse eID="Acts.8.1" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.2" osisID="Acts.8.2" n="2" />Some religious men buried Stephen, with loud lamentations for him.
<verse eID="Acts.8.2" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.3" osisID="Acts.8.3" n="3" />But Saul began to devastate the church; he entered house after house, dragged out men and women alike, and threw them into prison.
<verse eID="Acts.8.3" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.8.4" osisID="Acts.8.4" n="4" />Now those who were scattered in different directions went from place to place proclaiming the good news.
<verse eID="Acts.8.4" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.5" osisID="Acts.8.5" n="5" />Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and there began to preach the Christ.
<verse eID="Acts.8.5" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.6" osisID="Acts.8.6" n="6" />The people, one and all, listened attentively to what Philip told them, when they heard of, and saw, the miracles which he was working.
<verse eID="Acts.8.6" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.7" osisID="Acts.8.7" n="7" />For there were many instances of people with foul spirits, where the spirits, with loud screams, came out of them;
<verse eID="Acts.8.7" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.8" osisID="Acts.8.8" n="8" />and many who were paralyzed or lame were cured, so that there was great rejoicing throughout that city.
<verse eID="Acts.8.8" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.9" osisID="Acts.8.9" n="9" />There was staying in the city a man named Simon, who had been practicing magic there and mystifying the Samaritan people, giving himself out to be some great being.
<verse eID="Acts.8.9" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.10" osisID="Acts.8.10" n="10" />Everyone, high and low, paid attention to him. ‘This man,’ they used to say, ‘must be that power of God which people call “The Great Power.”’
<verse eID="Acts.8.10" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.11" osisID="Acts.8.11" n="11" />And they paid attention to him because they had for a long time been mystified by his magic arts.
<verse eID="Acts.8.11" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.12" osisID="Acts.8.12" n="12" />However, when they came to believe Philip, as he told them the good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.
<verse eID="Acts.8.12" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.13" osisID="Acts.8.13" n="13" />Even Simon believed, and after his baptism attached himself to Philip, and was in his turn mystified at seeing signs and great miracles constantly occurring.
<verse eID="Acts.8.13" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.8.14" osisID="Acts.8.14" n="14" />When the apostles at Jerusalem heard that the Samaritans had welcomed God’s message, they sent Peter and John to them;
<verse eID="Acts.8.14" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.15" osisID="Acts.8.15" n="15" />and they, on their arrival, prayed that the Samaritans might receive the Holy Spirit.
<verse eID="Acts.8.15" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.16" osisID="Acts.8.16" n="16" />(As yet the Spirit had not descended on any of them; they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus).
<verse eID="Acts.8.16" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.17" osisID="Acts.8.17" n="17" />Then Peter and John placed their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.
<verse eID="Acts.8.17" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.8.18" osisID="Acts.8.18" n="18" />When Simon saw that it was through the placing of the apostles’ hands on them that the Spirit was given, he brought them a sum of money and said,
<verse eID="Acts.8.18" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.19" osisID="Acts.8.19" n="19" />“Give me also this power of yours, so that, if I place my hands on anyone, he may receive the Holy Spirit.”
<verse eID="Acts.8.19" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.8.20" osisID="Acts.8.20" n="20" />“A curse on you and on your money,” Peter exclaimed, “for thinking that God’s free gift can be bought with gold!
<verse eID="Acts.8.20" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.21" osisID="Acts.8.21" n="21" />You have no share or part in our message, for your heart is not right with God.
<verse eID="Acts.8.21" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.22" osisID="Acts.8.22" n="22" />Therefore repent of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord, that, if possible, you may be forgiven for such a thought;
<verse eID="Acts.8.22" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.23" osisID="Acts.8.23" n="23" />for I see that you have fallen into the bitterness of envy and the fetters of sin.”
<verse eID="Acts.8.23" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.8.24" osisID="Acts.8.24" n="24" />“Pray to the Lord for me, all of you,” Simon answered, “so that none of the things you have spoken of may happen to me.”
<verse eID="Acts.8.24" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.8.25" osisID="Acts.8.25" n="25" />Peter and John, having borne their testimony and delivered the Lord’s message, returned to Jerusalem, telling the good news, as they went, in many Samaritan villages.
<verse eID="Acts.8.25" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.8.26" osisID="Acts.8.26" n="26" />Meanwhile an angel of the Lord had said to Philip, “Set out on a journey southwards, along the road that runs down from Jerusalem to Gaza.” (It is now deserted).
<verse eID="Acts.8.26" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.27" osisID="Acts.8.27" n="27" />So Philip set out on a journey; and on his way he came on an official of high rank, in the service of Candace, Queen of the Abyssinians. He was her treasurer, and had been to Jerusalem to worship,
<verse eID="Acts.8.27" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.28" osisID="Acts.8.28" n="28" />and was now on his way home, sitting in his carriage and reading the prophet Isaiah.
<verse eID="Acts.8.28" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.8.29" osisID="Acts.8.29" n="29" />The Spirit said to Philip, “Go up to the carriage over there and keep close to it.”
<verse eID="Acts.8.29" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.30" osisID="Acts.8.30" n="30" />So Philip ran up, and he heard the Abyssinian reading the prophet Isaiah.
</p>
<p>
“Do you understand what you are reading?” he asked.
<verse eID="Acts.8.30" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.31" osisID="Acts.8.31" n="31" />“How can I,” the other answered, “unless someone will explain it to me?” and he invited Philip to get up and sit by his side.
<verse eID="Acts.8.31" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.32" osisID="Acts.8.32" n="32" />The passage of scripture which he was reading was this –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘Like a sheep, he was led away to slaughter,</l>
<l level="2">and as a lamb is dumb in the hands of its shearer,</l>
<l level="2">so he refrains from opening his lips. <verse eID="Acts.8.32" /></l>
<l level="1">
<verse sID="Acts.8.33" osisID="Acts.8.33" n="33" />He was humiliated and justice was denied him.</l>
<l level="1">Who will tell the story of his generation?</l>
<l level="2">For his life is cut off from earth.’ <verse eID="Acts.8.33" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Acts.8.34" osisID="Acts.8.34" n="34" />“Now,” said the Treasurer, addressing Philip, “tell me, of whom is the prophet speaking? Of himself, or of someone else?”
<verse eID="Acts.8.34" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.35" osisID="Acts.8.35" n="35" />Then Philip began, and, taking this passage as his text, told him the good news about Jesus.
<verse eID="Acts.8.35" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.8.36" osisID="Acts.8.36" n="36" />Presently, as they were going along the road, they came to some water, and the Treasurer exclaimed, “Look! Here is water; what is to prevent my being baptized?”
<verse eID="Acts.8.36" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.37" osisID="Acts.8.37" n="37" /><note placement="foot"><reference type="annotateRef">8:37 </reference>Some later manuscripts add: Philip said, “If you believe with your whole heart, you may.” And he replied, “I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.”</note>
<verse eID="Acts.8.37" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.38" osisID="Acts.8.38" n="38" />So he ordered the carriage to stop, and they went down into the water – both Philip and the Treasurer – and Philip baptized him.
<verse eID="Acts.8.38" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.39" osisID="Acts.8.39" n="39" />But, when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught Philip away, and the Treasurer saw no more of him; for he continued his journey with a joyful heart.
<verse eID="Acts.8.39" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.40" osisID="Acts.8.40" n="40" />But Philip was found at Ashdod, and, as he went on his way, he told the good news in all the towns through which he passed, until he came to Caesarea.
<verse eID="Acts.8.40" />
<chapter eID="Acts.8" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Acts.9" osisID="Acts.9" n="9" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.1" osisID="Acts.9.1" n="1" />Meanwhile Saul, still breathing murderous threats against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest,
<verse eID="Acts.9.1" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.2" osisID="Acts.9.2" n="2" />and asked him to give him letters to the Jewish congregations at Damascus, authorizing him, if he found there any supporters of the Way, whether men or women, to have them put in chains and brought to Jerusalem.
<verse eID="Acts.9.2" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.9.3" osisID="Acts.9.3" n="3" />While on his journey, as he was nearing Damascus, suddenly a light from the heavens flashed around him.
<verse eID="Acts.9.3" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.4" osisID="Acts.9.4" n="4" />He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him – <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?”</q>
<verse eID="Acts.9.4" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.9.5" osisID="Acts.9.5" n="5" />“Who are you, Lord?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
<q who="Jesus" marker="">“I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,”</q>  the voice answered;
<verse eID="Acts.9.5" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.6" osisID="Acts.9.6" n="6" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Yet stand up and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do.”</q>
<verse eID="Acts.9.6" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.9.7" osisID="Acts.9.7" n="7" />The men traveling with Saul were meanwhile standing speechless; they heard the sound of the voice, but saw no one.
<verse eID="Acts.9.7" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.8" osisID="Acts.9.8" n="8" />When Saul got up from the ground, though his eyes were open, he could see nothing. So his men led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus;
<verse eID="Acts.9.8" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.9" osisID="Acts.9.9" n="9" />and for three days he was unable to see, and took nothing either to eat or to drink.
<verse eID="Acts.9.9" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.9.10" osisID="Acts.9.10" n="10" />Now there was at Damascus a disciple named Ananias, to whom, in a vision, the Lord said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Ananias.”</q>
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Lord,” he answered.
<verse eID="Acts.9.10" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.11" osisID="Acts.9.11" n="11" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">“Go at once,”</q>  said the Lord, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“to the Straight Street, and ask at Judas’s house for a man named Saul, from Tarsus. He is at this moment praying,</q>
<verse eID="Acts.9.11" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.12" osisID="Acts.9.12" n="12" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">and he has seen, in a vision, a man named Ananias coming in and placing his hands on him, so that he may recover his sight.”</q>
<verse eID="Acts.9.12" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.9.13" osisID="Acts.9.13" n="13" />“Lord,” exclaimed Ananias, “I have heard from many people about this man – how much harm he has done at Jerusalem to your people there.
<verse eID="Acts.9.13" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.14" osisID="Acts.9.14" n="14" />And, here, too, he holds authority from the chief priests to put in chains all those who invoke your name.”
<verse eID="Acts.9.14" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.15" osisID="Acts.9.15" n="15" />But the Lord said to him, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Go, for this man is my chosen instrument to uphold my name before the Gentiles and their kings, and the people of Israel.</q>
<verse eID="Acts.9.15" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.16" osisID="Acts.9.16" n="16" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">I will myself show him all that he has to suffer for my name.”</q>
<verse eID="Acts.9.16" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.9.17" osisID="Acts.9.17" n="17" />So Ananias went, entered the house, and, placing his hands on Saul, said, “Saul, my brother, I have been sent by the Lord – by Jesus, who appeared to you on your way here – so that you may recover your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.”
<verse eID="Acts.9.17" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.18" osisID="Acts.9.18" n="18" />Instantly it seemed as if a film fell from Saul’s eyes, and his sight was restored. Then he got up and was baptized,
<verse eID="Acts.9.18" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.19" osisID="Acts.9.19" n="19" />and, after he had taken food, he felt his strength return.
</p>
<p>
Saul stayed for some days with the disciples who were at Damascus,
<verse eID="Acts.9.19" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.20" osisID="Acts.9.20" n="20" />and at once began in the synagogues to proclaim Jesus as the Son of God.
<verse eID="Acts.9.20" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.21" osisID="Acts.9.21" n="21" />All who heard him were amazed.
</p>
<p>
“Is not this,” they asked, “the man who worked havoc in Jerusalem among those that invoke this name, and who had also come here for the express purpose of having such persons put in chains and taken before the chief priests?”
<verse eID="Acts.9.21" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.22" osisID="Acts.9.22" n="22" />Saul’s influence, however, kept steadily increasing, and he confounded the Jewish people who lived in Damascus by the proofs that he gave that Jesus was the Christ.
<verse eID="Acts.9.22" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.9.23" osisID="Acts.9.23" n="23" />After some time some of them laid a plot to kill Saul,
<verse eID="Acts.9.23" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.24" osisID="Acts.9.24" n="24" />but it became known to him. They even watched the gates day and night, to kill him;
<verse eID="Acts.9.24" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.25" osisID="Acts.9.25" n="25" />but his disciples let him down by night through an opening in the wall, lowering him in a basket.
<verse eID="Acts.9.25" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.9.26" osisID="Acts.9.26" n="26" />On his arrival in Jerusalem, Saul attempted to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, as they did not believe that he was really a disciple.
<verse eID="Acts.9.26" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.27" osisID="Acts.9.27" n="27" />Barnabas, however, taking him by the hand, brought him to the apostles, and told them the whole story of how Saul on his journey had seen the Lord, and how the Lord had talked to him, and how in Damascus he had spoken out fearlessly in the name of Jesus.
<verse eID="Acts.9.27" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.28" osisID="Acts.9.28" n="28" />After that, Saul remained in Jerusalem, in close contact with the apostles; and he spoke fearlessly in the name of the Lord,
<verse eID="Acts.9.28" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.29" osisID="Acts.9.29" n="29" />talking and arguing with the Jews of foreign birth, who, however, made attempts to kill him.
<verse eID="Acts.9.29" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.30" osisID="Acts.9.30" n="30" />But, when the followers found this out, they took him down to Caesarea, and sent him on his way to Tarsus.
<verse eID="Acts.9.30" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.9.31" osisID="Acts.9.31" n="31" />And so it came about that the church, throughout Judea, Galilee, and Samaria, enjoyed peace and became firmly established; and, ordering its life by respect for the Lord and the help of the Holy Spirit, it increased in numbers.
<verse eID="Acts.9.31" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.9.32" osisID="Acts.9.32" n="32" />Peter, while traveling from place to place throughout the country, went down to visit the people of Christ living at Lydda.
<verse eID="Acts.9.32" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.33" osisID="Acts.9.33" n="33" />There he found a man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden for eight years with paralysis.
<verse eID="Acts.9.33" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.34" osisID="Acts.9.34" n="34" />“Aeneas,” Peter said to him, “Jesus Christ cures you. Get up, and make your bed.” Aeneas got up at once;
<verse eID="Acts.9.34" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.35" osisID="Acts.9.35" n="35" />and all the inhabitants of Lydda and of the Plain of Sharon saw him, and came over to the Lord’s side.
<verse eID="Acts.9.35" />
<lb type="x-p" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.36" osisID="Acts.9.36" n="36" />At Jaffa there lived a disciple whose name was Tabitha, which is in Greek ‘Dorcas’ – a Gazelle. Her life was spent in doing kind and charitable actions.
<verse eID="Acts.9.36" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.37" osisID="Acts.9.37" n="37" />Just at that time she was taken ill, and died; and they had washed her body and laid it out in an upstairs room.
<verse eID="Acts.9.37" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.38" osisID="Acts.9.38" n="38" />Jaffa was near Lydda, and the disciples, having heard that Peter was at Lydda, sent two men with the request that he come to them without delay.
<verse eID="Acts.9.38" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.39" osisID="Acts.9.39" n="39" />Peter returned with them at once. On his arrival, he was taken upstairs, and all the widows came around him in tears, showing the coats and other clothing which Dorcas had made while she was among them.
<verse eID="Acts.9.39" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.40" osisID="Acts.9.40" n="40" />But Peter sent everybody out of the room, and knelt down and prayed. Then, turning to the body, he said, “Tabitha! Stand up.”
</p>
<p>
She opened her eyes, and, seeing Peter, sat up.
<verse eID="Acts.9.40" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.41" osisID="Acts.9.41" n="41" />Giving her his hand, Peter raised her up, and, calling in the widows and others of Christ’s people, presented her to them alive.
<verse eID="Acts.9.41" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.42" osisID="Acts.9.42" n="42" />This became known all through Jaffa, and numbers of people came to believe in the Lord.
<verse eID="Acts.9.42" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.43" osisID="Acts.9.43" n="43" />And Peter stayed some days at Jaffa with a tanner named Simon.
<verse eID="Acts.9.43" />
<chapter eID="Acts.9" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Acts.10" osisID="Acts.10" n="10" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.1" osisID="Acts.10.1" n="1" />At Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, a captain in the regiment known as the ‘Italian Regiment,’
<verse eID="Acts.10.1" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.2" osisID="Acts.10.2" n="2" />A religious man and one who reverenced God, with all his household. He was liberal in his charities to the people, and prayed to God constantly.
<verse eID="Acts.10.2" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.3" osisID="Acts.10.3" n="3" />One afternoon, about three o’clock, he distinctly saw in a vision an angel from God come to him, and call him by name.
<verse eID="Acts.10.3" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.4" osisID="Acts.10.4" n="4" />Cornelius fixed his eyes on him and, in great alarm, said, “What is it, Lord?”
</p>
<p>
“Your prayers and your charities,” the angel answered, “have been an acceptable offering to God.
<verse eID="Acts.10.4" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.5" osisID="Acts.10.5" n="5" />And now, send messengers to Jaffa and fetch a man called Simon, who is also known as Peter.
<verse eID="Acts.10.5" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.6" osisID="Acts.10.6" n="6" />He is lodging with a tanner named Simon, who has a house near the sea.”
<verse eID="Acts.10.6" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.10.7" osisID="Acts.10.7" n="7" />When the angel, who had spoken to him, had gone, Cornelius called two servants and a religious soldier, who was one of his constant attendants,
<verse eID="Acts.10.7" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.8" osisID="Acts.10.8" n="8" />and, after telling them the whole story, sent them to Jaffa.
<verse eID="Acts.10.8" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.10.9" osisID="Acts.10.9" n="9" />On the next day, while these men were on their way, just as they were nearing the town, Peter went up on the housetop about midday to pray.
<verse eID="Acts.10.9" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.10" osisID="Acts.10.10" n="10" />He became hungry and wanted something to eat; but while it was being prepared, he fell into a trance,
<verse eID="Acts.10.10" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.11" osisID="Acts.10.11" n="11" />and saw that the heavens were open, and that something like a great sail was descending, let down by its four corners towards the earth.
<verse eID="Acts.10.11" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.12" osisID="Acts.10.12" n="12" />In it were all kinds of quadrupeds, reptiles, and birds.
<verse eID="Acts.10.12" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.13" osisID="Acts.10.13" n="13" />Then he was aware of a voice which said – <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Stand up, Peter, kill something, and eat.”</q>
<verse eID="Acts.10.13" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.10.14" osisID="Acts.10.14" n="14" />“No, Lord, I cannot,” answered Peter, “for I have never eaten anything defiled and unclean.”
<verse eID="Acts.10.14" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.15" osisID="Acts.10.15" n="15" />Again he was aware of a voice which said – <q who="Jesus" marker="">“What God has pronounced clean, do not regard as defiled.”</q>
<verse eID="Acts.10.15" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.16" osisID="Acts.10.16" n="16" />This happened three times, and then suddenly it was all taken up into the heavens.
<verse eID="Acts.10.16" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.10.17" osisID="Acts.10.17" n="17" />While Peter was still perplexed as to the meaning of the vision that he had seen, the men sent by Cornelius, having enquired the way to Simon’s house, came up to the gate,
<verse eID="Acts.10.17" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.18" osisID="Acts.10.18" n="18" />and called out and asked if the Simon, who was also known as Peter, was lodging there.
<verse eID="Acts.10.18" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.19" osisID="Acts.10.19" n="19" />Peter was still pondering over the vision, when the Spirit said to him, “There are two men looking for you at this moment.
<verse eID="Acts.10.19" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.20" osisID="Acts.10.20" n="20" />Go down at once and do not hesitate to go with them, for I have sent them.”
<verse eID="Acts.10.20" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.10.21" osisID="Acts.10.21" n="21" />Peter went down to the men and said, “I am the person you are looking for. What is your reason for coming?”
<verse eID="Acts.10.21" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.10.22" osisID="Acts.10.22" n="22" />The men replied, “Our captain, Cornelius, a pious man who reverences God and is well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation, has been instructed by a holy angel to send for you to his house, and to listen to what you have to say.”
<verse eID="Acts.10.22" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.23" osisID="Acts.10.23" n="23" />So Peter invited them in and entertained them.
</p>
<p>
The next day he lost no time in setting out with them, accompanied by some of the Lord’s followers from Jaffa;
<verse eID="Acts.10.23" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.24" osisID="Acts.10.24" n="24" />and the day following he entered Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them, and had invited his relatives and intimate friends to meet them.
<verse eID="Acts.10.24" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.25" osisID="Acts.10.25" n="25" />So, when Peter entered the city, Cornelius met him, and, throwing himself at Peter’s feet, bowed to the ground.
<verse eID="Acts.10.25" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.26" osisID="Acts.10.26" n="26" />Peter, however, lifted him up, saying as he did so, “Stand up, I am only human like yourself.”
<verse eID="Acts.10.26" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.10.27" osisID="Acts.10.27" n="27" />Talking with him as he went, Peter entered the house, where he found a large gathering of people, to whom he said,
<verse eID="Acts.10.27" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.28" osisID="Acts.10.28" n="28" />“You are doubtless aware that it is forbidden for a Jew to be intimate with a foreigner, or even to enter his house; and yet God has shown me that I ought not to call anyone defiled or unclean.
<verse eID="Acts.10.28" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.29" osisID="Acts.10.29" n="29" />That was why I came, when I was sent for, without raising any objection. And now I ask your reason for sending for me.”
<verse eID="Acts.10.29" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.10.30" osisID="Acts.10.30" n="30" />“Just three days ago this very hour,” Cornelius said, “I was in my house, saying the Afternoon Prayers, when a man in dazzling clothing suddenly stood before me.
<verse eID="Acts.10.30" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.31" osisID="Acts.10.31" n="31" />‘Cornelius,’ he said, ‘your prayer has been heard, and your charities have been accepted, by God.
<verse eID="Acts.10.31" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.32" osisID="Acts.10.32" n="32" />Therefore send to Jaffa, and invite the Simon, who is also known as Peter, to come here. He is lodging in the house of Simon the tanner, near the sea.’
<verse eID="Acts.10.32" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.33" osisID="Acts.10.33" n="33" />Accordingly I sent to you at once, and you have been so good as to come. And now we are all here in the presence of God, to listen to all that you have been instructed by the Lord to say.”
<verse eID="Acts.10.33" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.34" osisID="Acts.10.34" n="34" />Then Peter began.
</p>
<p>
“I see, beyond all doubt,” he said, “that God does not show partiality,
<verse eID="Acts.10.34" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.35" osisID="Acts.10.35" n="35" />but that in every nation he who reverences him and does what is right is acceptable to him.
<verse eID="Acts.10.35" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.36" osisID="Acts.10.36" n="36" />God has sent his message to the Israelites and told them, through Jesus Christ, the good news of peace – and Jesus is Lord of all!
<verse eID="Acts.10.36" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.37" osisID="Acts.10.37" n="37" />You yourselves know the story which spread through all Judea, how, beginning form Galilee, after the baptism which John proclaimed –
<verse eID="Acts.10.37" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.38" osisID="Acts.10.38" n="38" />The story, I mean, of Jesus of Nazareth, and how God consecrated him his Christ by enduing him with the Holy Spirit and with power; and how he went about doing good and curing all who were under the power of the devil, because God was with him.
<verse eID="Acts.10.38" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.39" osisID="Acts.10.39" n="39" />We are ourselves, too, witnesses to all that he did in Judea and in Jerusalem; yet they put him to death by hanging him on a cross!
<verse eID="Acts.10.39" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.40" osisID="Acts.10.40" n="40" />This Jesus God raised on the third day, and enabled him to appear,
<verse eID="Acts.10.40" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.41" osisID="Acts.10.41" n="41" />not indeed to everyone, but to witnesses chosen beforehand by God – to us, who ate and drank with him after his resurrection from the dead.
<verse eID="Acts.10.41" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.42" osisID="Acts.10.42" n="42" />Further, God charged us to proclaim to the people, and solemnly affirm, that it is Jesus who has been appointed by God judge of the living and the dead.
<verse eID="Acts.10.42" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.43" osisID="Acts.10.43" n="43" />To him it is that all the prophets bear witness, when they say that everyone who believes in him receives through his name forgiveness of sins.”
<verse eID="Acts.10.43" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.10.44" osisID="Acts.10.44" n="44" />Before Peter had finished saying these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all who were listening to the message.
<verse eID="Acts.10.44" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.45" osisID="Acts.10.45" n="45" />Those converts from Judaism, who had come with Peter, were amazed that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been bestowed even on the Gentiles;
<verse eID="Acts.10.45" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.46" osisID="Acts.10.46" n="46" />for they heard them speaking in different languages and extolling God. At this Peter asked,
<verse eID="Acts.10.46" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.47" osisID="Acts.10.47" n="47" />“Can anyone refuse the water for the baptism of these people, now that they have received the Holy Spirit as we did ourselves?”
<verse eID="Acts.10.47" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.48" osisID="Acts.10.48" n="48" />And he directed that they should be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ; after which they asked him to stay there a few days longer.
<verse eID="Acts.10.48" />
<chapter eID="Acts.10" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Acts.11" osisID="Acts.11" n="11" />
<verse sID="Acts.11.1" osisID="Acts.11.1" n="1" />The apostles and the followers throughout Judea heard that even the Gentiles had welcomed God’s message.
<verse eID="Acts.11.1" />
<verse sID="Acts.11.2" osisID="Acts.11.2" n="2" />But, when Peter went up to Jerusalem, those who were converts from Judaism began to attack him,
<verse eID="Acts.11.2" />
<verse sID="Acts.11.3" osisID="Acts.11.3" n="3" />on the ground that he had visited people who were not circumcised, and had taken meals with them.
<verse eID="Acts.11.3" />
<verse sID="Acts.11.4" osisID="Acts.11.4" n="4" />So Peter began to relate the facts to them as they had occurred.
<verse eID="Acts.11.4" />
<verse sID="Acts.11.5" osisID="Acts.11.5" n="5" />“I was in the town of Jaffa,” he said, “and was praying; and, while in a trance, I saw a vision. There was something like a great sail descending, let down by its four corners out of the heavens; and it came right down to me.
<verse eID="Acts.11.5" />
<verse sID="Acts.11.6" osisID="Acts.11.6" n="6" />Looking intently at it, I began to distinguish quadrupeds, wild beasts, reptiles, and birds;
<verse eID="Acts.11.6" />
<verse sID="Acts.11.7" osisID="Acts.11.7" n="7" />and I also heard a voice saying to me – <q who="Jesus" marker="">‘Stand up, Peter, kill something and eat.’</q>
<verse eID="Acts.11.7" />
<verse sID="Acts.11.8" osisID="Acts.11.8" n="8" />‘No, Lord, I cannot,’ I answered, ‘for nothing defiled or unclean has ever passed my lips.’
<verse eID="Acts.11.8" />
<verse sID="Acts.11.9" osisID="Acts.11.9" n="9" />Then a second time there came a voice from the heavens. <q who="Jesus" marker="">‘What God has pronounced clean’,</q>  it said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">‘you must not call defiled.’</q>
<verse eID="Acts.11.9" />
<verse sID="Acts.11.10" osisID="Acts.11.10" n="10" />This happened three times, and then all was drawn up again into the heavens.
<verse eID="Acts.11.10" />
<verse sID="Acts.11.11" osisID="Acts.11.11" n="11" />At that moment three men, who had been sent from Caesarea to see me, came up to the house in which we were.
<verse eID="Acts.11.11" />
<verse sID="Acts.11.12" osisID="Acts.11.12" n="12" />The Spirit told me to go with them without hesitation. These six companions also went with me. And, when we came into the man’s house,
<verse eID="Acts.11.12" />
<verse sID="Acts.11.13" osisID="Acts.11.13" n="13" />he told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house, and how the angel had said to him – ‘Send to Jaffa and fetch the Simon, who is also known as Peter;
<verse eID="Acts.11.13" />
<verse sID="Acts.11.14" osisID="Acts.11.14" n="14" />for he will tell you truths, which will prove the means of salvation to you and all your household.’
<verse eID="Acts.11.14" />
<verse sID="Acts.11.15" osisID="Acts.11.15" n="15" />I had but just begun to speak,” continued Peter, “when the Holy Spirit fell on them, exactly as on us at the first;
<verse eID="Acts.11.15" />
<verse sID="Acts.11.16" osisID="Acts.11.16" n="16" />and I recalled the saying of the Master – <q who="Jesus" marker="">‘John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.’</q>
<verse eID="Acts.11.16" />
<verse sID="Acts.11.17" osisID="Acts.11.17" n="17" />Since then, God had given them the very same gift as he gave us when we became believers in Jesus Christ the Master – who was I that I could thwart God?”
<verse eID="Acts.11.17" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.11.18" osisID="Acts.11.18" n="18" />On hearing this statement, they said no more, but broke out into praise of God. “So even to the Gentiles,” they exclaimed, “God has granted the repentance which leads to life!”
<verse eID="Acts.11.18" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.11.19" osisID="Acts.11.19" n="19" />Now those who had been scattered in different directions, in consequence of the persecution that followed the death of Stephen, went as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, telling the message – but only to Jews.
<verse eID="Acts.11.19" />
<verse sID="Acts.11.20" osisID="Acts.11.20" n="20" />Some of them, however, who were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, on coming to Antioch, addressed themselves also to the Jews of foreign birth, telling them the good news about that Lord Jesus.
<verse eID="Acts.11.20" />
<verse sID="Acts.11.21" osisID="Acts.11.21" n="21" />The power of the Lord was with them, so that a great number who had learned to believe came over to the Lord’s side.
<verse eID="Acts.11.21" />
<verse sID="Acts.11.22" osisID="Acts.11.22" n="22" />The news about them reached the ears of the church at Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.
<verse eID="Acts.11.22" />
<verse sID="Acts.11.23" osisID="Acts.11.23" n="23" />On coming there he saw to his great joy these tokens of the loving kindness of God, and encouraged them all to make up their minds to be faithful to the Lord –
<verse eID="Acts.11.23" />
<verse sID="Acts.11.24" osisID="Acts.11.24" n="24" />For Barnabas was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith – and a large number of people took their stand on the Lord’s side.
<verse eID="Acts.11.24" />
<verse sID="Acts.11.25" osisID="Acts.11.25" n="25" />Afterward Barnabas left for Tarsus to look for Saul;
<verse eID="Acts.11.25" />
<verse sID="Acts.11.26" osisID="Acts.11.26" n="26" />and, when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. And so it came about that, for a whole year, they attended the meetings of the church there, and taught a large number of people; and it was in Antioch that the disciples were first called ‘Christians.’
<verse eID="Acts.11.26" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.11.27" osisID="Acts.11.27" n="27" />During this time, some prophets came to Antioch from Jerusalem.
<verse eID="Acts.11.27" />
<verse sID="Acts.11.28" osisID="Acts.11.28" n="28" />One of them, named Agabus, came forward and, under the influence of the Spirit, foretold a great famine that was to spread over all the world – a famine which occurred in the reign of Claudius.
<verse eID="Acts.11.28" />
<verse sID="Acts.11.29" osisID="Acts.11.29" n="29" />So the disciples, without exception, determined, in proportion to their means, to send something to help the followers living in Judea.
<verse eID="Acts.11.29" />
<verse sID="Acts.11.30" osisID="Acts.11.30" n="30" />And this they did, sending it to the church elders by Barnabas and Saul.
<verse eID="Acts.11.30" />
<chapter eID="Acts.11" />

<p>
<chapter sID="Acts.12" osisID="Acts.12" n="12" />
<verse sID="Acts.12.1" osisID="Acts.12.1" n="1" />It was at that time that King Herod began to ill-treat some of the members of the church.
<verse eID="Acts.12.1" />
<verse sID="Acts.12.2" osisID="Acts.12.2" n="2" />He had James, the brother of John, beheaded;
<verse eID="Acts.12.2" />
<verse sID="Acts.12.3" osisID="Acts.12.3" n="3" />and, when he saw that the Jews were pleased with this, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. (This was during the Festival of the unleavened bread.)
<verse eID="Acts.12.3" />
<verse sID="Acts.12.4" osisID="Acts.12.4" n="4" />After seizing Peter, Herod put him in prison, and entrusted him to the keeping of four Guards of four soldiers each, intending, after the Passover, to bring him up before the people.
<verse eID="Acts.12.4" />
<verse sID="Acts.12.5" osisID="Acts.12.5" n="5" />So Peter was kept in prison, but meanwhile the prayers of the church were being earnestly offered to God on his behalf.
<verse eID="Acts.12.5" />
<verse sID="Acts.12.6" osisID="Acts.12.6" n="6" />Just when Herod was intending to bring him before the people, on that very night Peter was asleep between two soldiers, chained to them both, while there were sentries in front of the door, guarding the prison.
<verse eID="Acts.12.6" />
<verse sID="Acts.12.7" osisID="Acts.12.7" n="7" />Suddenly an angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shone in the cell. The angel struck Peter on the side, and roused him with the words, “Get up quickly.”
<verse eID="Acts.12.7" />
<verse sID="Acts.12.8" osisID="Acts.12.8" n="8" />The chains dropped from his wrists, and then the angel said, “Put on your belt and sandals.” When Peter had done so, the angel added, “Throw your cloak around you and follow me.”
<verse eID="Acts.12.8" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.12.9" osisID="Acts.12.9" n="9" />Peter followed him out, not knowing that what was happening under the angel’s guidance was real, but thinking that he was seeing a vision.
<verse eID="Acts.12.9" />
<verse sID="Acts.12.10" osisID="Acts.12.10" n="10" />Passing the first Guard, and then the second, they came to the iron gate leading into the city, which opened to them of itself; and, when they had passed through that, and had walked along one street, all at once the angel left him.
<verse eID="Acts.12.10" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.12.11" osisID="Acts.12.11" n="11" />Then Peter came to himself and said, “Now I know beyond all doubt that the Lord has sent his angel, and has rescued me from Herod’s hands and from all that the Jewish people have been expecting.”
<verse eID="Acts.12.11" />
<verse sID="Acts.12.12" osisID="Acts.12.12" n="12" />As soon as he realized what had happened, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John who was also known as Mark, where a number of people were gathered together, praying.
<verse eID="Acts.12.12" />
<verse sID="Acts.12.13" osisID="Acts.12.13" n="13" />On his knocking at the door in the gate, a maidservant, named Rhoda, came to answer it.
<verse eID="Acts.12.13" />
<verse sID="Acts.12.14" osisID="Acts.12.14" n="14" />She recognized Peter’s voice, but in her joy left the gate unopened, and ran in, and told them that Peter was standing outside.
<verse eID="Acts.12.14" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.12.15" osisID="Acts.12.15" n="15" />“You are mad!” they exclaimed. But, when she persisted that it was so, they said, “It must be his spirit!”
<verse eID="Acts.12.15" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.12.16" osisID="Acts.12.16" n="16" />Meanwhile Peter went on knocking, and, when they opened the gate and saw him, they were amazed.
<verse eID="Acts.12.16" />
<verse sID="Acts.12.17" osisID="Acts.12.17" n="17" />Peter signed to them with his hand to be silent, and then told them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison, adding, “Tell James and the others all this.” Then he left the house, and went away to another place.
<verse eID="Acts.12.17" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.12.18" osisID="Acts.12.18" n="18" />In the morning there was a great stir among the soldiers – what could have become of Peter!
<verse eID="Acts.12.18" />
<verse sID="Acts.12.19" osisID="Acts.12.19" n="19" />And, when Herod had made further search for him and failed to find him, he closely questioned the Guard, and ordered them away to execution. Then he went down from Judea to stay at Caesarea.
<verse eID="Acts.12.19" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.12.20" osisID="Acts.12.20" n="20" />It happened that Herod was deeply offended with the people of Tyre and Sidon, but they went in a body to him, and, having succeeded in winning over Blastus, the Chamberlain, they begged Herod for a reconciliation, because their country was dependent on the king’s for its food supply.
<verse eID="Acts.12.20" />
<verse sID="Acts.12.21" osisID="Acts.12.21" n="21" />On an appointed day Herod, wearing his state robes, seated himself on his throne, and delivered an oration.
<verse eID="Acts.12.21" />
<verse sID="Acts.12.22" osisID="Acts.12.22" n="22" />The people kept shouting, “It is the voice of God, and not of a person!”
<verse eID="Acts.12.22" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.12.23" osisID="Acts.12.23" n="23" />Instantly an angel of the Lord struck him, because he did not give God the glory; and he was attacked with worms, and died.
<verse eID="Acts.12.23" />
<verse sID="Acts.12.24" osisID="Acts.12.24" n="24" />Meanwhile the Lord’s message kept extending, and spreading far and wide.
<verse eID="Acts.12.24" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.12.25" osisID="Acts.12.25" n="25" />When Barnabas and Saul had carried out their mission, they returned to Jerusalem, and took with them John, who was also known as Mark.

<p>
Among the members of the church at Antioch there were several prophets and teachers – Barnabas, Simeon who was known by the name of ‘Black’, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen, foster-brother of Prince Herod, and Saul.
<verse eID="Acts.13.1" />
<verse sID="Acts.13.2" osisID="Acts.13.2" n="2" />While they were engaged in the worship of the Lord and were fasting, the Holy Spirit said, “Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul, for the work to which I have called them.”
<verse eID="Acts.13.2" />
<verse sID="Acts.13.3" osisID="Acts.13.3" n="3" />Accordingly, after fasting and prayer, they placed their hands on them and dismissed them.
<verse eID="Acts.13.3" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.13.4" osisID="Acts.13.4" n="4" />Barnabas and Saul, sent on this mission, as they were, by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia, and from there sailed to Cyprus.
<verse eID="Acts.13.4" />
<verse sID="Acts.13.5" osisID="Acts.13.5" n="5" />On reaching Salamis, they began to tell the message of God in the Jewish synagogues; and they had John with them as an assistant.
<verse eID="Acts.13.5" />
<verse sID="Acts.13.6" osisID="Acts.13.6" n="6" />After passing through the whole island, they reached Paphos, where they found an astrologer who pretended to be a prophet – a Jew by birth, whose name was Barjoshua.
<verse eID="Acts.13.6" />
<verse sID="Acts.13.7" osisID="Acts.13.7" n="7" />He was at the court of the Governor, Sergius Paulus, a man of intelligence, who sent for Barnabas and Saul and asked to be told God’s message.
<verse eID="Acts.13.7" />
<verse sID="Acts.13.8" osisID="Acts.13.8" n="8" />But Elymas, the astrologer (for that is the meaning of the word), opposed them, eager to divert the Governor’s attention from the faith.
<verse eID="Acts.13.8" />
<verse sID="Acts.13.9" osisID="Acts.13.9" n="9" />However, Saul (who is the same as Paul), full of the Holy Spirit, fixed his eyes on him and said,
<verse eID="Acts.13.9" />
<verse sID="Acts.13.10" osisID="Acts.13.10" n="10" />“You incarnation of deceit and all fraud! You son of the devil! You opponent of all that is good! Will you never cease to divert the straight paths of the Lord? Listen!
<verse eID="Acts.13.10" />
<verse sID="Acts.13.11" osisID="Acts.13.11" n="11" />The hand of the Lord is on you even now, and you will be blind for a time and unable to see the sun.” Immediately a mist and darkness fell on him, and he went feeling about for someone to guide him.
<verse eID="Acts.13.11" />
<verse sID="Acts.13.12" osisID="Acts.13.12" n="12" />When the Governor saw what had happened, he became a believer in Christ, being greatly impressed by the teaching about the Lord.
<verse eID="Acts.13.12" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.13.13" osisID="Acts.13.13" n="13" />After this, Paul and his companions set sail from Paphos and went to Perga in Pamphylia, where John left them and returned to Jerusalem.
<verse eID="Acts.13.13" />
<verse sID="Acts.13.14" osisID="Acts.13.14" n="14" />The others went on from Perga and arrived at Antioch in Pisidia. There they went into the synagogue on the Sabbath and took their seats.
<verse eID="Acts.13.14" />
<verse sID="Acts.13.15" osisID="Acts.13.15" n="15" />After the reading of the Law and the prophets, the synagogue leader sent them this message – “Friends, if you have any helpful words to address to the people, now is the time to speak.”
<verse eID="Acts.13.15" />
<verse sID="Acts.13.16" osisID="Acts.13.16" n="16" />So Paul rose and, motioning with his hand, said:
</p>
<p>
“People of Israel and all here who worship God, hear what I have to say.
<verse eID="Acts.13.16" />
<verse sID="Acts.13.17" osisID="Acts.13.17" n="17" />The God of this people Israel chose our ancestors, and during their stay in Egypt increased the prosperity of the people, and then with uplifted arm brought them out from that land.
<verse eID="Acts.13.17" />
<verse sID="Acts.13.18" osisID="Acts.13.18" n="18" />For about forty years he bore with them in the desert;
<verse eID="Acts.13.18" />
<verse sID="Acts.13.19" osisID="Acts.13.19" n="19" />then, after destroying seven heathen nations in Canaan, he allotted their land to this people –
<verse eID="Acts.13.19" />
<verse sID="Acts.13.20" osisID="Acts.13.20" n="20" />For about four hundred and fifty years. In later times he gave them Judges, of whom the prophet Samuel was the last.
<verse eID="Acts.13.20" />
<verse sID="Acts.13.21" osisID="Acts.13.21" n="21" />And, when they demanded a king, God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, who reigned for forty years.
<verse eID="Acts.13.21" />
<verse sID="Acts.13.22" osisID="Acts.13.22" n="22" />After removing him, he raised David to the throne, and bore this testimony to him – ‘In David, the son of Jesse, I have found a man after my own heart, who will carry out all my purposes.’
<verse eID="Acts.13.22" />
<verse sID="Acts.13.23" osisID="Acts.13.23" n="23" />It was from this man’s descendants that God, in accordance with his promise, gave Israel a Savior – Jesus;
<verse eID="Acts.13.23" />
<verse sID="Acts.13.24" osisID="Acts.13.24" n="24" />John having first proclaimed, before the appearance of Jesus, a baptism on repentance for all the people of Israel.
<verse eID="Acts.13.24" />
<verse sID="Acts.13.25" osisID="Acts.13.25" n="25" />As John was drawing towards the end of his career, he said ‘What do you suppose that I am? I am not the Christ. But there is “one coming” after me, whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.’
<verse eID="Acts.13.25" />
<verse sID="Acts.13.26" osisID="Acts.13.26" n="26" />Brothers and sisters, descendants of Abraham, and all those among you who worship God, it was to us that the message of this salvation was sent.
<verse eID="Acts.13.26" />
<verse sID="Acts.13.27" osisID="Acts.13.27" n="27" />The people of Jerusalem and their leaders, failing to recognize Jesus, and not understanding the utterances of the prophets that are read every Sabbath, fulfilled them by condemning him.
<verse eID="Acts.13.27" />
<verse sID="Acts.13.28" osisID="Acts.13.28" n="28" />They found no ground at all for putting him to death, and yet demanded his execution from Pilate;
<verse eID="Acts.13.28" />
<verse sID="Acts.13.29" osisID="Acts.13.29" n="29" />and, after carrying out everything written about him, they took Jesus down from the cross, and laid him in a tomb.
<verse eID="Acts.13.29" />
<verse sID="Acts.13.30" osisID="Acts.13.30" n="30" />But God raised him from the dead;
<verse eID="Acts.13.30" />
<verse sID="Acts.13.31" osisID="Acts.13.31" n="31" />and he appeared for many days to those who had gone up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, and who are now witnesses for him to the people.
<verse eID="Acts.13.31" />
<verse sID="Acts.13.32" osisID="Acts.13.32" n="32" />We also have good news to tell you, about the promise made to our ancestors –
<verse eID="Acts.13.32" />
<verse sID="Acts.13.33" osisID="Acts.13.33" n="33" />That our children have had this promise completely fulfilled to them by God, by his raising Jesus. That is just what is said in the second Psalm –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘You are my Son; this day I have become your Father.’ <verse eID="Acts.13.33" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Acts.13.34" osisID="Acts.13.34" n="34" />As to his raising Jesus from the dead, never again to return to corruption, this is what is said –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘I will give to you the sacred promises made to David;’ <verse eID="Acts.13.34" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Acts.13.35" osisID="Acts.13.35" n="35" />And, therefore, in another Psalm it is said –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘You will not give up the Holy One to undergo corruption.’ <verse eID="Acts.13.35" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Acts.13.36" osisID="Acts.13.36" n="36" />David, after obediently doing God’s will in his own time, fell asleep and was laid by the side of his ancestors, and did undergo corruption;
<verse eID="Acts.13.36" />
<verse sID="Acts.13.37" osisID="Acts.13.37" n="37" />but Jesus, whom God raised from the dead, did not undergo corruption.
<verse eID="Acts.13.37" />
<verse sID="Acts.13.38" osisID="Acts.13.38" n="38" />I would, therefore, like you to know, friends, that through Jesus forgiveness of sins is being proclaimed to you,
<verse eID="Acts.13.38" />
<verse sID="Acts.13.39" osisID="Acts.13.39" n="39" />and that, in union with him, everyone who believes in him is absolved from every sin from which under the Law of Moses you could not be absolved.
<verse eID="Acts.13.39" />
<verse sID="Acts.13.40" osisID="Acts.13.40" n="40" />Beware, therefore, that what is said in the prophets does not come true of you –

<l level="1">
<verse sID="Acts.13.41" osisID="Acts.13.41" n="41" />‘Look, you despisers, and wonder, and perish;</l>

<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Acts.13.42" osisID="Acts.13.42" n="42" />As Paul and Barnabas were leaving the synagogue, the people begged for a repetition of this teaching on the next Sabbath.
<verse eID="Acts.13.42" />
<verse sID="Acts.13.43" osisID="Acts.13.43" n="43" />After the congregation had dispersed, many of the Jews, and of the converts who joined in their worship, followed Paul and Barnabas, who talked with them and urged them to continue to rely on the loving kindness of God.
<verse eID="Acts.13.43" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.13.44" osisID="Acts.13.44" n="44" />On the following Sabbath, almost all the city gathered to hear God’s message.
<verse eID="Acts.13.44" />
<verse sID="Acts.13.45" osisID="Acts.13.45" n="45" />But the sight of the crowds of people filled the minds of the Jews with jealousy, and they kept contradicting Paul’s statements in violent language.
<verse eID="Acts.13.45" />
<verse sID="Acts.13.46" osisID="Acts.13.46" n="46" />Then Paul and Barnabas spoke out fearlessly, and said:
</p>
<p>
“It was necessary that the message of God should be told to you first; but, since you reject it and reckon yourselves not worthy of the eternal life – we turn to the Gentiles!
<verse eID="Acts.13.46" />
<verse sID="Acts.13.47" osisID="Acts.13.47" n="47" />For this is the Lord’s command to us –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘I have destined you for a light to the Gentiles,</l>
<l level="1">a means of salvation to the ends of the earth’.” <verse eID="Acts.13.47" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Acts.13.48" osisID="Acts.13.48" n="48" />On hearing this, the Gentiles were glad and extolled God’s message; and all those who had been enrolled for eternal life became believers in Christ;
<verse eID="Acts.13.48" />
<verse sID="Acts.13.49" osisID="Acts.13.49" n="49" />and the Lord’s message was carried throughout that district.
<verse eID="Acts.13.49" />
<verse sID="Acts.13.50" osisID="Acts.13.50" n="50" />But the Jews incited the women of high social standing who worshiped with them, and the leading men of the town, and started a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of their region.
<verse eID="Acts.13.50" />
<verse sID="Acts.13.51" osisID="Acts.13.51" n="51" />They, however, shook the dust off their feet in protest,
<verse eID="Acts.13.51" />
<verse sID="Acts.13.52" osisID="Acts.13.52" n="52" />and went to Iconium, leaving the disciples full of joy and of the Holy Spirit.
<verse eID="Acts.13.52" />
<chapter eID="Acts.13" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Acts.14" osisID="Acts.14" n="14" />
<verse sID="Acts.14.1" osisID="Acts.14.1" n="1" />The same thing occurred in Iconium, where Paul and Barnabas went into the Jewish synagogue, and spoke in such a way that a great number of both Jews and Greeks believed in Christ.
<verse eID="Acts.14.1" />
<verse sID="Acts.14.2" osisID="Acts.14.2" n="2" />But the Jews who refused to believe stirred up the Gentiles, and poisoned their minds against the Lord’s followers.
<verse eID="Acts.14.2" />
<verse sID="Acts.14.3" osisID="Acts.14.3" n="3" />Therefore Paul and Barnabas spent a long time there, and spoke out fearlessly, relying on the Lord, who confirmed the message of his love by permitting signs and wonders to take place at their hands.
<verse eID="Acts.14.3" />
<verse sID="Acts.14.4" osisID="Acts.14.4" n="4" />But the townspeople were divided, some siding with the Jews, some with the apostles;
<verse eID="Acts.14.4" />
<verse sID="Acts.14.5" osisID="Acts.14.5" n="5" />and, when there was an attempt on the part of both Gentiles and Jews, with their leaders, to resort to violence and to stone them,
<verse eID="Acts.14.5" />
<verse sID="Acts.14.6" osisID="Acts.14.6" n="6" />the apostles heard of it, and took refuge in Lystra and Derbe, towns in Lycaonia, and in the district around,
<verse eID="Acts.14.6" />
<verse sID="Acts.14.7" osisID="Acts.14.7" n="7" />and there they continued to tell the good news.
<verse eID="Acts.14.7" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.14.8" osisID="Acts.14.8" n="8" />In the streets of Lystra there used to sit a man who had no power in his feet; he had been lame from his birth, and had never walked.
<verse eID="Acts.14.8" />
<verse sID="Acts.14.9" osisID="Acts.14.9" n="9" />This man was listening to Paul speaking, when Paul, looking intently at him, and seeing that he had the faith to be healed,
<verse eID="Acts.14.9" />
<verse sID="Acts.14.10" osisID="Acts.14.10" n="10" />said loudly, “Stand upright on your feet.”
</p>
<p>
The man leaped up, and began walking about,
<verse eID="Acts.14.10" />
<verse sID="Acts.14.11" osisID="Acts.14.11" n="11" />and the crowd, seeing what Paul had done, called out in the Lycaonian language, “The Gods have come down to us in human form.”
<verse eID="Acts.14.11" />
<verse sID="Acts.14.12" osisID="Acts.14.12" n="12" />So they called Barnabas ‘Zeus,’ and Paul ‘Hermes,’ because he took the lead in speaking;
<verse eID="Acts.14.12" />
<verse sID="Acts.14.13" osisID="Acts.14.13" n="13" />and the priest of Zeus-beyond-the-Walls, accompanied by the crowd, brought bullocks and garlands to the gates, with the intention of offering sacrifices.
<verse eID="Acts.14.13" />
<verse sID="Acts.14.14" osisID="Acts.14.14" n="14" />But, when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore their clothes and rushed out into the crowd.
</p>
<p>
“Friends, why are you doing this?” they shouted.
<verse eID="Acts.14.14" />
<verse sID="Acts.14.15" osisID="Acts.14.15" n="15" />“We are only people like yourselves, and we have come with the good news that you should turn away from these follies to a living God, who made the heavens, the earth, the sea, and everything that is in them.
<verse eID="Acts.14.15" />
<verse sID="Acts.14.16" osisID="Acts.14.16" n="16" />In bygone times he permitted all the nations to go their own ways.
<verse eID="Acts.14.16" />
<verse sID="Acts.14.17" osisID="Acts.14.17" n="17" />Yet he has not failed to give you, in the good he does, some revelation of himself – sending you from heaven rain and fruitful seasons, and gladdening your hearts with plenty and good cheer.”
<verse eID="Acts.14.17" />
<verse sID="Acts.14.18" osisID="Acts.14.18" n="18" />Even with this appeal they could hardly restrain the people from offering sacrifice to them.
<verse eID="Acts.14.18" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.14.19" osisID="Acts.14.19" n="19" />Presently, however, there came some Jews from Antioch, and Iconium who, after they had won over the people, stoned Paul, and dragged him out of the town, thinking him to be dead.
<verse eID="Acts.14.19" />
<verse sID="Acts.14.20" osisID="Acts.14.20" n="20" />But, when the disciples had gathered around him, he got up and went back into the town; the next day he went with Barnabas to Derbe.
<verse eID="Acts.14.20" />
<verse sID="Acts.14.21" osisID="Acts.14.21" n="21" />After telling the good news throughout that town, and making a number of converts, they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch,
<verse eID="Acts.14.21" />
<verse sID="Acts.14.22" osisID="Acts.14.22" n="22" />reassuring the minds of the disciples, urging them to remain true to the faith, and showing that it is only through many troubles that we can enter the kingdom of God.
<verse eID="Acts.14.22" />
<verse sID="Acts.14.23" osisID="Acts.14.23" n="23" />They also appointed elders for them in every church, and, after prayer and fasting, commended them to the Lord in whom they had learned to believe.
<verse eID="Acts.14.23" />
<verse sID="Acts.14.24" osisID="Acts.14.24" n="24" />Paul and Barnabas then went through Pisidia, and came into Pamphylia,
<verse eID="Acts.14.24" />
<verse sID="Acts.14.25" osisID="Acts.14.25" n="25" />and, after telling the message at Perga, went down to Attaleia.
<verse eID="Acts.14.25" />
<verse sID="Acts.14.26" osisID="Acts.14.26" n="26" />From there they sailed to Antioch – the place where they had been committed to the gracious care of God for the work which they had now finished.
<verse eID="Acts.14.26" />
<verse sID="Acts.14.27" osisID="Acts.14.27" n="27" />After their arrival, they gathered the church together, and gave an account of all that God had helped them to do, and especially how he had opened to the Gentiles the door of faith;
<verse eID="Acts.14.27" />
<verse sID="Acts.14.28" osisID="Acts.14.28" n="28" />and at Antioch they stayed with the disciples for a considerable time.
<verse eID="Acts.14.28" />
<chapter eID="Acts.14" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Acts.15" osisID="Acts.15" n="15" />
<verse sID="Acts.15.1" osisID="Acts.15.1" n="1" />But certain persons came down from Judea, and began to teach the Lord’s followers that, unless they were circumcised, in accordance with the custom required by Moses, they could not be saved.
<verse eID="Acts.15.1" />
<verse sID="Acts.15.2" osisID="Acts.15.2" n="2" />This gave rise to a serious dispute, and much discussion, between Paul and Barnabas and these people, and it was therefore settled that Paul and Barnabas and others of their number should go up to Jerusalem, to consult the apostles and church elders about the matter under discussion.
<verse eID="Acts.15.2" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.15.3" osisID="Acts.15.3" n="3" />The church, therefore, sent them on their journey, and they made their way through Phoenicia and Samaria, telling the story of the conversion of the Gentiles, to the great joy of all the followers.
<verse eID="Acts.15.3" />
<verse sID="Acts.15.4" osisID="Acts.15.4" n="4" />On their arrival at Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church, as well as by the apostles and the elders, and gave an account of all that God had helped them to do.
<verse eID="Acts.15.4" />
<verse sID="Acts.15.5" osisID="Acts.15.5" n="5" />Some of the Pharisees’ party, however, who had become believers in Christ, came forward and declared that they were bound to circumcise converts and to direct them to observe the Law of Moses.
<verse eID="Acts.15.5" />
<verse sID="Acts.15.6" osisID="Acts.15.6" n="6" />The apostles and the church elders held a meeting to consider this question.
<verse eID="Acts.15.6" />
<verse sID="Acts.15.7" osisID="Acts.15.7" n="7" />After much discussion, Peter rose and said:
</p>
<p>
“You, my friends, know well that long ago God singled me out – that through my lips the Gentiles should hear the message of the good news, and become believers in Christ.
<verse eID="Acts.15.7" />
<verse sID="Acts.15.8" osisID="Acts.15.8" n="8" />Now God, who reads all hearts, declared his acceptance of the Gentiles, by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as he did to us.
<verse eID="Acts.15.8" />
<verse sID="Acts.15.9" osisID="Acts.15.9" n="9" />He made no distinction between them and us, when he purified their hearts by their faith.
<verse eID="Acts.15.9" />
<verse sID="Acts.15.10" osisID="Acts.15.10" n="10" />Why, then, do you now provoke God, by putting on the necks of these disciples a yoke which neither our ancestors nor we were able to bear?
<verse eID="Acts.15.10" />
<verse sID="Acts.15.11" osisID="Acts.15.11" n="11" />No, it is through the loving kindness of the Lord Jesus that we, just as they do, believe that we have been saved.”
<verse eID="Acts.15.11" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.15.12" osisID="Acts.15.12" n="12" />Every voice in the assembly was hushed, as they listened to Barnabas and Paul, while they gave an account of all the signs and wonders which God had shown among the Gentiles through them.
<verse eID="Acts.15.12" />
<verse sID="Acts.15.13" osisID="Acts.15.13" n="13" />After they had finished speaking, James addressed the Council.
</p>
<p>
“Friends,” he began, “hear what I have to say.
<verse eID="Acts.15.13" />
<verse sID="Acts.15.14" osisID="Acts.15.14" n="14" />Simon has described the manner in which God first visited the Gentiles, in order to take from among them a people to bear his name.
<verse eID="Acts.15.14" />
<verse sID="Acts.15.15" osisID="Acts.15.15" n="15" />And that is in harmony with the words of the prophets, where they say –
<verse eID="Acts.15.15" />
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">
<verse sID="Acts.15.16" osisID="Acts.15.16" n="16" />‘After this I will return;</l>

<l level="1">
<verse sID="Acts.15.17" osisID="Acts.15.17" n="17" />that so the rest of mankind may earnestly seek the Lord –</l>

<l level="2">
<verse sID="Acts.15.18" osisID="Acts.15.18" n="18" />says the Lord, as he does these things, known from long ago.’ <verse eID="Acts.15.18" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Acts.15.19" osisID="Acts.15.19" n="19" />In my judgment, therefore, we should not add to the difficulties of those Gentiles who are turning to God,
<verse eID="Acts.15.19" />
<verse sID="Acts.15.20" osisID="Acts.15.20" n="20" />but we should write to them to abstain from food that has been polluted by being sacrificed to idols, from impurity, from eating the flesh of strangled animals, and from blood.
<verse eID="Acts.15.20" />
<verse sID="Acts.15.21" osisID="Acts.15.21" n="21" />For in every town, for generations past, there have been those who preach Moses, read as he is in the synagogues every Sabbath.”
<verse eID="Acts.15.21" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.15.22" osisID="Acts.15.22" n="22" />It was then decided by the apostles and the elders, with the assent of the whole church, to choose some of their number, and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. Those chosen were Judas (called Barsabas) and Silas, who were leaders among the community.
<verse eID="Acts.15.22" />
<verse sID="Acts.15.23" osisID="Acts.15.23" n="23" />They were bearers of the following letter –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘The apostles, and the followers who are the church elders, send their greetings to the followers of the Lord of Gentile birth in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia.
<verse eID="Acts.15.23" />
<verse sID="Acts.15.24" osisID="Acts.15.24" n="24" />As we had heard that some of our number had upset you by their assertions, and unsettled your minds – without instructions from us –
<verse eID="Acts.15.24" />
<verse sID="Acts.15.25" osisID="Acts.15.25" n="25" />We met and decided to choose certain men and send them to you with our dear friends Barnabas and Paul,
<verse eID="Acts.15.25" />
<verse sID="Acts.15.26" osisID="Acts.15.26" n="26" />who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ.
<verse eID="Acts.15.26" />
<verse sID="Acts.15.27" osisID="Acts.15.27" n="27" />We are accordingly sending Judas and Silas, and they will tell you by word of mouth what we are now writing.
<verse eID="Acts.15.27" />
<verse sID="Acts.15.28" osisID="Acts.15.28" n="28" />We have, therefore, decided, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, to lay no further burden on you beyond these necessary conditions –
<verse eID="Acts.15.28" />
<verse sID="Acts.15.29" osisID="Acts.15.29" n="29" />That you abstain from food offered to idols, from blood, from eating the flesh of strangled animals, and from impurity. If you guard yourselves against such things, it will be well with you. Farewell.’ <verse eID="Acts.15.29" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Acts.15.30" osisID="Acts.15.30" n="30" />So the bearers of this letter were sent on their way, and went down to Antioch. There they called a meeting of all the followers,
<verse eID="Acts.15.30" />
<verse sID="Acts.15.31" osisID="Acts.15.31" n="31" />and delivered the letter, the reading of which caused great rejoicing by its encouraging contents.
<verse eID="Acts.15.31" />
<verse sID="Acts.15.32" osisID="Acts.15.32" n="32" />Judas and Silas, who were themselves prophets, further encouraged the them by many an address, and strengthened their faith.
<verse eID="Acts.15.32" />
<verse sID="Acts.15.33" osisID="Acts.15.33" n="33" />After some stay, they were dismissed with kind farewells from the followers, and returned to those who had sent them.

</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.15.35" osisID="Acts.15.35" n="35" />Paul and Barnabas, however, remained in Antioch, where they taught and, with the help of many others, told the good news of the Lord’s message.
<verse eID="Acts.15.35" />
<verse sID="Acts.15.36" osisID="Acts.15.36" n="36" />Some time after this, Paul said to Barnabas, “Let us go back and visit the Lord’s followers in every town in which we have told the Lord’s message, and see how they are prospering.”
<verse eID="Acts.15.36" />
<verse sID="Acts.15.37" osisID="Acts.15.37" n="37" />Barnabas wished to take with them John, whose other name was Mark;
<verse eID="Acts.15.37" />
<verse sID="Acts.15.38" osisID="Acts.15.38" n="38" />but Paul felt that they ought not to take with them the man who had deserted them in Pamphylia, and had not gone on with them to their work.
<verse eID="Acts.15.38" />
<verse sID="Acts.15.39" osisID="Acts.15.39" n="39" />This caused such unpleasant feeling between them that they parted ways, Barnabas taking Mark and sailing for Cyprus,
<verse eID="Acts.15.39" />
<verse sID="Acts.15.40" osisID="Acts.15.40" n="40" />while Paul chose Silas for his companion and, after he had been committed by the followers to the gracious care of the Lord,
<verse eID="Acts.15.40" />
<verse sID="Acts.15.41" osisID="Acts.15.41" n="41" />started on his journey and went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches in the faith.

<p>
<chapter sID="Acts.16" osisID="Acts.16" n="16" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.1" osisID="Acts.16.1" n="1" />Among other places Paul went to Derbe and Lystra. At the latter place they found a disciple, named Timothy, whose mother was a Jewish woman who was a believer, while his father was a Greek,
<verse eID="Acts.16.1" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.2" osisID="Acts.16.2" n="2" />and who was well spoken of by the followers of the Lord in Lystra and Iconium.
<verse eID="Acts.16.2" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.3" osisID="Acts.16.3" n="3" />Wishing to take this man with him on his journey, Paul caused him to be circumcised out of consideration for the Jews in that region, for they all knew that his father had been a Greek.
<verse eID="Acts.16.3" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.4" osisID="Acts.16.4" n="4" />As they traveled from town to town, they gave the followers the decisions which had been reached by the apostles and church elders at Jerusalem, for them to observe.
<verse eID="Acts.16.4" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.16.5" osisID="Acts.16.5" n="5" />So the churches grew stronger in the faith, and increased in numbers from day to day.
<verse eID="Acts.16.5" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.16.6" osisID="Acts.16.6" n="6" />They next went through the Phrygian district of Galatia, but were restrained by the Holy Spirit from delivering the message in Roman Asia.
<verse eID="Acts.16.6" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.7" osisID="Acts.16.7" n="7" />When they reached the borders of Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not permit them.
<verse eID="Acts.16.7" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.8" osisID="Acts.16.8" n="8" />Passing through Mysia, they went down to Troas;
<verse eID="Acts.16.8" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.9" osisID="Acts.16.9" n="9" />and there one night Paul saw a vision. A Macedonian was standing and appealing to him – ‘Come over to Macedonia and help us.’
<verse eID="Acts.16.9" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.10" osisID="Acts.16.10" n="10" />So, immediately after Paul had seen the vision, we looked for an opportunity to cross over to Macedonia, concluding that God had summoned us to tell the good news to the people there.
<verse eID="Acts.16.10" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.16.11" osisID="Acts.16.11" n="11" />Accordingly we set sail from Troas, and ran before the wind to Samothrace, reaching Neapolis the next day.
<verse eID="Acts.16.11" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.12" osisID="Acts.16.12" n="12" />From there we made our way to Philippi, which is the principal city of that part of Macedonia, and also a Roman Settlement.
</p>
<p>
In that city we spent several days.
<verse eID="Acts.16.12" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.13" osisID="Acts.16.13" n="13" />On the Sabbath we went outside the gate to the riverside, where we supposed there would be a place of prayer; and we sat down and talked to the women who were gathered there.
<verse eID="Acts.16.13" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.14" osisID="Acts.16.14" n="14" />Among them was a woman, named Lydia, belonging to Thyatira, a dealer in purple cloth, who was accustomed to join in the worship of God. The Lord touched this woman’s heart, so that she gave attention to the message delivered by Paul,
<verse eID="Acts.16.14" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.15" osisID="Acts.16.15" n="15" />and, when she and her household had been baptized, she urged us to become her guests.
</p>
<p>
“Since you have shown your conviction,” she said, “that I really am a believer in the Lord, come and stay in my house.” And she insisted on our doing so.
<verse eID="Acts.16.15" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.16.16" osisID="Acts.16.16" n="16" />One day, as we were on our way to the place of prayer, we were met by a girl possessed by a divining spirit, who made large profits for her masters by fortune-telling.
<verse eID="Acts.16.16" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.17" osisID="Acts.16.17" n="17" />This girl followed Paul and the rest of us, calling, “These men are servants of the most high God, and they are bringing you news of a way to salvation.”
<verse eID="Acts.16.17" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.18" osisID="Acts.16.18" n="18" />She had been doing this for several days, when Paul, much vexed, turned and said to the spirit within her, “In the name of Jesus Christ I command you to leave her.” That very moment the spirit left her.
<verse eID="Acts.16.18" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.16.19" osisID="Acts.16.19" n="19" />When her masters saw that there was no hope of further profit from her, they seized Paul and Silas, dragged them into the public square to the authorities,
<verse eID="Acts.16.19" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.20" osisID="Acts.16.20" n="20" />and took them before the Magistrates.
</p>
<p>
“These men are causing a great disturbance in our town,” they complained;
<verse eID="Acts.16.20" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.21" osisID="Acts.16.21" n="21" />“They are Jews, and they are teaching customs which it is not right for us, as Romans, to sanction or adopt.”
<verse eID="Acts.16.21" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.16.22" osisID="Acts.16.22" n="22" />The mob rose as one person against them, and the Magistrates stripped them of their clothing and ordered them to be beaten with rods.
<verse eID="Acts.16.22" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.23" osisID="Acts.16.23" n="23" />After beating them severely, the Magistrates put them in prison, with orders to the jailer to keep them in safe custody.
<verse eID="Acts.16.23" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.24" osisID="Acts.16.24" n="24" />On receiving so strict an order, the Governor put them into the inner cell, and secured their feet in the stocks.
<verse eID="Acts.16.24" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.25" osisID="Acts.16.25" n="25" />About midnight, while Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and while the prisoners were listening to them,
<verse eID="Acts.16.25" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.26" osisID="Acts.16.26" n="26" />suddenly there was an earthquake of such violence that the jail was shaken to its foundations; all the doors flew open, and all the prisoners’ chains were loosened.
<verse eID="Acts.16.26" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.27" osisID="Acts.16.27" n="27" />Roused from his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, the Governor drew his sword intending to kill himself, in the belief that the prisoners had escaped.
<verse eID="Acts.16.27" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.28" osisID="Acts.16.28" n="28" />But Paul called our loudly, “Do not harm yourself; we are all here.”
<verse eID="Acts.16.28" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.16.29" osisID="Acts.16.29" n="29" />Calling for a light, the Governor rushed in, and flung himself trembling at the feet of Paul and Silas.
<verse eID="Acts.16.29" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.30" osisID="Acts.16.30" n="30" />Then he led them out, and said, “What must I do to be saved?”
<verse eID="Acts.16.30" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.16.31" osisID="Acts.16.31" n="31" />“Believe in Jesus, our Lord,” they replied, “and you will be saved, you and your household too.”
<verse eID="Acts.16.31" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.32" osisID="Acts.16.32" n="32" />Then they spoke to him of God’s message, and to all his household as well.
<verse eID="Acts.16.32" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.33" osisID="Acts.16.33" n="33" />And that very hour of the night he took them and washed their wounds, and he himself and everyone belonging to him were baptized without delay.
<verse eID="Acts.16.33" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.34" osisID="Acts.16.34" n="34" />Afterward he took them up to his house and set before them something to eat, rejoicing that he, with all his household, had come to believe in God.
<verse eID="Acts.16.34" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.16.35" osisID="Acts.16.35" n="35" />In the morning the Magistrates sent the police with an order for the men to be discharged.
<verse eID="Acts.16.35" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.36" osisID="Acts.16.36" n="36" />The jailer told Paul of his instructions. “The Magistrates have sent an order for your discharge,” he said, “so you had better leave the place at once and go quietly away.”
<verse eID="Acts.16.36" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.16.37" osisID="Acts.16.37" n="37" />But Paul’s answer to them was, “They have flogged us in public without trial, though we are Roman citizens, and they have put us in prison, and now they are for sending us out secretly! No, indeed! Let them come and take us out themselves.”
<verse eID="Acts.16.37" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.38" osisID="Acts.16.38" n="38" />The police reported his words to the Magistrates, who, on hearing that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens, were alarmed,
<verse eID="Acts.16.38" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.39" osisID="Acts.16.39" n="39" />and went to the prison, and did their best to conciliate them. Then they took them out, and begged them to leave the city.
<verse eID="Acts.16.39" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.40" osisID="Acts.16.40" n="40" />When Paul and Silas left the prison, they went to Lydia’s house, and, after they had seen the Lord’s followers, and encouraged them, they left the place.
<verse eID="Acts.16.40" />
<chapter eID="Acts.16" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Acts.17" osisID="Acts.17" n="17" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.1" osisID="Acts.17.1" n="1" />After passing through Amphipolis and Apollonia, Paul and Silas came to Thessalonica. Here the Jews had a synagogue;
<verse eID="Acts.17.1" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.2" osisID="Acts.17.2" n="2" />and, following his usual custom, Paul joined them, and for three Sabbaths addressed them, drawing his arguments from the scriptures.
<verse eID="Acts.17.2" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.3" osisID="Acts.17.3" n="3" />He laid before them and explained that the Christ must undergo suffering and rise from the dead; and “It is this man,” he declared, “who is the Christ – this Jesus about whom I am telling you.”
<verse eID="Acts.17.3" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.17.4" osisID="Acts.17.4" n="4" />Some of the people were convinced, and threw in their lot with Paul and Silas, as did also a large body of Greeks who were accustomed to join in the Jewish services, and a great number of leading women.
<verse eID="Acts.17.4" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.5" osisID="Acts.17.5" n="5" />But the Jewish leaders, becoming jealous, engaged some worthless fellows from the streets, and, getting a mob together, kept the city in an uproar. They attacked Jason’s house, with the intention of bringing Paul and Silas before the Popular Assembly;
<verse eID="Acts.17.5" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.6" osisID="Acts.17.6" n="6" />and, not finding them there, they proceeded to drag Jason and some of the Lord’s followers before the city magistrates, shouting out,
</p>
<p>
“These men, who have turned the world upside down, have now come here,
<verse eID="Acts.17.6" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.7" osisID="Acts.17.7" n="7" />and have been harbored by Jason! They are all defying the decrees of the Emperor. They say that someone else is king – a man called Jesus!”
<verse eID="Acts.17.7" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.17.8" osisID="Acts.17.8" n="8" />On hearing this, the people and the city magistrates were much concerned;
<verse eID="Acts.17.8" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.9" osisID="Acts.17.9" n="9" />and, before letting them go, they took bail from Jason and the others.
<verse eID="Acts.17.9" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.10" osisID="Acts.17.10" n="10" />That very night the followers sent Paul and Silas off to Beroea; and on reaching that place, they went to the Jewish synagogue.
<verse eID="Acts.17.10" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.11" osisID="Acts.17.11" n="11" />These Jews of Beroea were better disposed than those in Thessalonica, for they welcomed the message with great readiness, and daily examined the scriptures to see if what was said was true.
<verse eID="Acts.17.11" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.12" osisID="Acts.17.12" n="12" />As a consequence, many of them became believers in Christ, besides a considerable number of Greek women of position, and of men also.
<verse eID="Acts.17.12" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.13" osisID="Acts.17.13" n="13" />But, when the Jewish leaders in Thessalonica found out that God’s message had been delivered by Paul at Beroea, they came there too, exciting and disturbing the minds of the people.
<verse eID="Acts.17.13" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.14" osisID="Acts.17.14" n="14" />The followers immediately arranged for Paul to go away to the coast, but both Silas and Timothy stayed behind in Beroea.
<verse eID="Acts.17.14" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.15" osisID="Acts.17.15" n="15" />The friends who escorted Paul took him as far as Athens, and, after receiving a message for Silas and Timothy to join him as quickly as possible, they started on their return.
<verse eID="Acts.17.15" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.17.16" osisID="Acts.17.16" n="16" />While Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his heart was stirred at seeing the whole city full of idols.
<verse eID="Acts.17.16" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.17" osisID="Acts.17.17" n="17" />So he argued in the synagogue with the Jews and with those who joined in their worship, as well as daily in the public Square with those who happened to be there.
<verse eID="Acts.17.17" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.18" osisID="Acts.17.18" n="18" />Among others, some Epicurean and Stoic Philosophers joined issue with him. Some asked “What is this prater wanting to make out?”, while others said “He seems to be a preacher of foreign Deities.” (This was because he was telling the good news about Jesus and the resurrection).
<verse eID="Acts.17.18" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.19" osisID="Acts.17.19" n="19" />So they laid hold of him and took him to the Court of Areopagus.
</p>
<p>
“May we hear,” they asked, “what new teaching this is which you are giving?
<verse eID="Acts.17.19" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.20" osisID="Acts.17.20" n="20" />For you are bringing some strange things to our notice, and we should like to know what they mean.”
<verse eID="Acts.17.20" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.21" osisID="Acts.17.21" n="21" />(All Athenians and the foreigners staying in the city found no time for anything else but telling, or listening to, the last new thing.)
<verse eID="Acts.17.21" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.17.22" osisID="Acts.17.22" n="22" />So Paul took his stand in the middle of the Court, and said – “People of Athens, on every hand I see signs of your being very devout.
<verse eID="Acts.17.22" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.23" osisID="Acts.17.23" n="23" />For as I was going about, looking at your sacred shrines, I came upon an altar with this inscription – ‘To an Unknown God.’ What, therefore, you worship in ignorance, that I am now proclaiming to you.
<verse eID="Acts.17.23" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.24" osisID="Acts.17.24" n="24" />The God who made the world and all things that are in it – he, Lord as he is of heaven and earth, does not live in temples made by hands,
<verse eID="Acts.17.24" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.25" osisID="Acts.17.25" n="25" />neither do human hands minister to his wants, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives, to all, life, and breath, and all things.
<verse eID="Acts.17.25" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.26" osisID="Acts.17.26" n="26" />He made all races of the earth’s surface – fixing a time for their rise and fall, and the limits of their settlements –
<verse eID="Acts.17.26" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.27" osisID="Acts.17.27" n="27" />That they might search for God, if by any means they might feel their way to him and find him. And yet he is not really far from any one of us;
<verse eID="Acts.17.27" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.28" osisID="Acts.17.28" n="28" />for in him we live and move and are. To use the words of some of your own poets –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘His offspring, too, are we.’ <verse eID="Acts.17.28" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Acts.17.29" osisID="Acts.17.29" n="29" />Therefore, as the offspring of God, we must not think that the Deity has any resemblance to anything made of gold, or silver, or stone – a work of human art and imagination.
<verse eID="Acts.17.29" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.30" osisID="Acts.17.30" n="30" />True, God looked with indulgence on the days of people’s ignorance, but now he is announcing to everyone everywhere the need for repentance,
<verse eID="Acts.17.30" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.31" osisID="Acts.17.31" n="31" />because he has fixed a day on which he intends to judge the world with justice, by a man whom he has appointed – and of this he has given all people a pledge by raising this man from the dead.”
<verse eID="Acts.17.31" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.17.32" osisID="Acts.17.32" n="32" />On hearing of a resurrection of the dead, some began jeering, but others said that they wanted to hear what he had to say about that another time.
<verse eID="Acts.17.32" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.33" osisID="Acts.17.33" n="33" />And so Paul left the Court.
<verse eID="Acts.17.33" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.34" osisID="Acts.17.34" n="34" />There were, however, some people who joined him, and became believers in Christ. Among them were Dionysius, a member of the Court of Areopagus, a woman named Damaris, and several others.
<verse eID="Acts.17.34" />
<chapter eID="Acts.17" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Acts.18" osisID="Acts.18" n="18" />
<verse sID="Acts.18.1" osisID="Acts.18.1" n="1" />On leaving Athens, Paul next went to Corinth.
<verse eID="Acts.18.1" />
<verse sID="Acts.18.2" osisID="Acts.18.2" n="2" />There he met a Jew of the name of Aquila, from Pontus, who, with his wife Priscilla, had lately come from Italy, in consequence of the order which had been issued by the Emperor Claudius for all Jews to leave Rome. Paul paid them a visit,
<verse eID="Acts.18.2" />
<verse sID="Acts.18.3" osisID="Acts.18.3" n="3" />and, since their trade was the same as his, he stayed and worked with them – their trade was tent-making.
<verse eID="Acts.18.3" />
<verse sID="Acts.18.4" osisID="Acts.18.4" n="4" />Every Sabbath Paul gave addresses in the synagogue, trying to convince both Jews and Greeks.
<verse eID="Acts.18.4" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.18.5" osisID="Acts.18.5" n="5" />But, when Silas and Timothy had come down from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself entirely to delivering the message, earnestly maintaining before the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.
<verse eID="Acts.18.5" />
<verse sID="Acts.18.6" osisID="Acts.18.6" n="6" />However, as they set themselves against him and became abusive, Paul shook his clothes in protest and said to them, “Your blood be on your own heads. My conscience is clear. From this time forward I will go to the Gentiles.”
<verse eID="Acts.18.6" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.18.7" osisID="Acts.18.7" n="7" />So he left, and went to the house of a certain Titius Justus, who had been accustomed to join in the worship of God, and whose house was next door to the synagogue.
<verse eID="Acts.18.7" />
<verse sID="Acts.18.8" osisID="Acts.18.8" n="8" />Crispus, the synagogue leader, came to believe in the Lord, and so did all his household; and many of the Corinthians, as they listened to Paul, became believers in Christ and were baptized.
<verse eID="Acts.18.8" />
<verse sID="Acts.18.9" osisID="Acts.18.9" n="9" />One night the Lord said to Paul, in a vision, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Have no fear, but continue to speak, and refuse to be silenced;</q>
<verse eID="Acts.18.9" />
<verse sID="Acts.18.10" osisID="Acts.18.10" n="10" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">for I am with you, and no one will do you harm, for I have many people in this city.”</q>
<verse eID="Acts.18.10" />
<verse sID="Acts.18.11" osisID="Acts.18.11" n="11" />So he settled there for a year and a half, and taught God’s message among the people.
<verse eID="Acts.18.11" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.18.12" osisID="Acts.18.12" n="12" />While Gallio was governor of Greece, some of the Jewish leaders made a combined attack on Paul, and brought him before the Governor’s Bench,
<verse eID="Acts.18.12" />
<verse sID="Acts.18.13" osisID="Acts.18.13" n="13" />charging him with persuading people to worship God in a way forbidden by the Law.
<verse eID="Acts.18.13" />
<verse sID="Acts.18.14" osisID="Acts.18.14" n="14" />Just as Paul was on the point of speaking, Gallio said to them, “If this were a case of misdemeanor or some serious crime, there would be some reason for my listening patiently to you;
<verse eID="Acts.18.14" />
<verse sID="Acts.18.15" osisID="Acts.18.15" n="15" />but, since it is a dispute about words, and names, and your own Law, you must see to it yourselves. I do not choose to be a judge in such matters.”
<verse eID="Acts.18.15" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.18.16" osisID="Acts.18.16" n="16" />Saying this, he drove them back from the Bench.
<verse eID="Acts.18.16" />
<verse sID="Acts.18.17" osisID="Acts.18.17" n="17" />Then they all set on Sosthenes, the synagogue leader, and beat him in front of the Bench, but Gallio did not trouble himself about any of these things.
<verse eID="Acts.18.17" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.18.18" osisID="Acts.18.18" n="18" />Paul remained there some time after this, and then took leave of the followers, and sailed to Syria with Priscilla and Aquila, but not before his head had been shaved at Cenchreae, because he was under a vow.
<verse eID="Acts.18.18" />
<verse sID="Acts.18.19" osisID="Acts.18.19" n="19" />They put into Ephesus, and there Paul, leaving his companions, went into the synagogue and addressed the Jews.
<verse eID="Acts.18.19" />
<verse sID="Acts.18.20" osisID="Acts.18.20" n="20" />When they asked him to prolong his stay, he declined, saying however,
<verse eID="Acts.18.20" />
<verse sID="Acts.18.21" osisID="Acts.18.21" n="21" />as he took his leave, “I will come back again to you, please God,” and then set sail from Ephesus.
<verse eID="Acts.18.21" />
<verse sID="Acts.18.22" osisID="Acts.18.22" n="22" />On reaching Caesarea, he went up to Jerusalem and exchanged greetings with the church, and then went down to Antioch.
<verse eID="Acts.18.22" />
<verse sID="Acts.18.23" osisID="Acts.18.23" n="23" />After making some stay in Antioch, he set out on a tour through the Phrygian district of Galatia, strengthening the faith of all the disciples as he went.
<verse eID="Acts.18.23" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.18.24" osisID="Acts.18.24" n="24" />Meanwhile there had come to Ephesus an Alexandrian Jew, named Apollos, an eloquent man, who was well-versed in the scriptures.
<verse eID="Acts.18.24" />
<verse sID="Acts.18.25" osisID="Acts.18.25" n="25" />He had been well-instructed in the Way of the Lord, and with burning zeal he spoke of, and taught carefully, the facts about Jesus, though he knew of no baptism but John’s.
<verse eID="Acts.18.25" />
<verse sID="Acts.18.26" osisID="Acts.18.26" n="26" />This man began to speak out fearlessly in the synagogue; and when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him home and explained the Way of God to him more carefully still.
<verse eID="Acts.18.26" />
<verse sID="Acts.18.27" osisID="Acts.18.27" n="27" />When he wanted to cross to Greece, the followers furthered his plans, and wrote to the disciples there to welcome him. On his arrival he proved of great assistance to those who had, through the loving kindness of God, become believers in Christ,
<verse eID="Acts.18.27" />
<verse sID="Acts.18.28" osisID="Acts.18.28" n="28" />for he vigorously confuted the Jews, publicly proving by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.

<chapter sID="Acts.19" osisID="Acts.19" n="19" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.1" osisID="Acts.19.1" n="1" />While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul passed through the inland districts of Roman Asia, and went to Ephesus. There he found some disciples, of whom he asked,
<verse eID="Acts.19.1" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.2" osisID="Acts.19.2" n="2" />“Did you, when you became believers in Christ, receive the Holy Spirit?”
</p>
<p>
“No,” they answered, “we did not even hear that there was a Holy Spirit.”
<verse eID="Acts.19.2" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.19.3" osisID="Acts.19.3" n="3" />“What then was your baptism?” Paul asked.
<verse eID="Acts.19.3" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.4" osisID="Acts.19.4" n="4" />“John’s baptism was a baptism on repentance,” rejoined Paul, “and John told the people (speaking of the ‘one coming’ after him) that they should believe in him – that is in Jesus.”
<verse eID="Acts.19.4" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.19.5" osisID="Acts.19.5" n="5" />On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus,
<verse eID="Acts.19.5" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.6" osisID="Acts.19.6" n="6" />and, after Paul had placed his hands on them, the Holy Spirit descended on them, and they began to speak in other languages and to preach.
<verse eID="Acts.19.6" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.7" osisID="Acts.19.7" n="7" />There were about twelve of them in all.
<verse eID="Acts.19.7" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.19.8" osisID="Acts.19.8" n="8" />Paul went to the synagogue there, and for three months spoke out fearlessly, giving addresses and trying to convince his hearers, about the kingdom of God.
<verse eID="Acts.19.8" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.9" osisID="Acts.19.9" n="9" />Some of them, however, hardened their hearts and refused to believe, denouncing the Way before the people. So Paul left them and withdrew his disciples, and gave daily addresses in the lecture-hall of Tyrannus.
<verse eID="Acts.19.9" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.10" osisID="Acts.19.10" n="10" />This went on for two years, so that all who lived in Roman Asia, Jews and Greeks alike, heard the Lord’s message.
<verse eID="Acts.19.10" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.19.11" osisID="Acts.19.11" n="11" />God did miracles of no ordinary kind by Paul’s hands;
<verse eID="Acts.19.11" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.12" osisID="Acts.19.12" n="12" />so that people would carry home to the sick handkerchiefs or aprons that had touched his body, and their diseases would leave them and the wicked spirits go out of them.
<verse eID="Acts.19.12" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.13" osisID="Acts.19.13" n="13" />An attempt was made by some itinerant Jews, who were exorcists, to use the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had wicked spirits in them.
</p>
<p>
“I order you,” they would say, “by the Jesus, whom Paul preaches.”
<verse eID="Acts.19.13" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.14" osisID="Acts.19.14" n="14" />The seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this;
<verse eID="Acts.19.14" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.15" osisID="Acts.19.15" n="15" />but the wicked spirit answered them, “Jesus I acknowledge, and Paul I know, but you – who are you?”
<verse eID="Acts.19.15" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.19.16" osisID="Acts.19.16" n="16" />Then the man, in whom this wicked spirit was, sprang on them, mastered both of them, and so completely overpowered them, that they fled out of the house, stripped of their clothes, and wounded.
<verse eID="Acts.19.16" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.17" osisID="Acts.19.17" n="17" />This incident came to the knowledge of all the Jews and Greeks living at Ephesus; they were all awe-struck, and the name of the Lord Jesus was held in the highest honor.
<verse eID="Acts.19.17" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.18" osisID="Acts.19.18" n="18" />Many, too, of those who had become believers in Christ came with a full confession of their practices;
<verse eID="Acts.19.18" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.19" osisID="Acts.19.19" n="19" />while a number of people, who had practiced magic, collected their books and burnt them publicly; and on reckoning up the price of these, they found it amounted to fifty thousand silver coins.
<verse eID="Acts.19.19" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.20" osisID="Acts.19.20" n="20" />So irresistibly did the Lord’s message spread and prevail.
<verse eID="Acts.19.20" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.19.21" osisID="Acts.19.21" n="21" />Sometime after these events Paul resolved to go through Macedonia and Greece, and then make his way to Jerusalem. “And after I have been there,” he said, “I must visit Rome also.”
<verse eID="Acts.19.21" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.22" osisID="Acts.19.22" n="22" />So he sent to Macedonia two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, while he himself stayed for some time longer in Roman Asia.
<verse eID="Acts.19.22" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.19.23" osisID="Acts.19.23" n="23" />Just about that time a great disturbance arose about the Way.
<verse eID="Acts.19.23" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.24" osisID="Acts.19.24" n="24" />A silversmith named Demetrius, who made silver models of the shrine of Artemis, and so gave a great deal of work to the artisans,
<verse eID="Acts.19.24" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.25" osisID="Acts.19.25" n="25" />got these men together, as well as the workmen engaged in similar occupations, and said:
</p>
<p>
“Men, you know that our prosperity depends on this work,
<verse eID="Acts.19.25" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.26" osisID="Acts.19.26" n="26" />and you see and hear that not only at Ephesus, but in almost the whole of Roman Asia, this Paul has convinced and won over great numbers of people, by his assertion that those Gods which are made by hands are not Gods at all.
<verse eID="Acts.19.26" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.27" osisID="Acts.19.27" n="27" />So that not only is this business of ours likely to fall into discredit, but there is the further danger that the Temple of the great Goddess Artemis will be thought nothing of, and that she herself will be deprived of her splendor – though all Roman Asia and the whole world worship her.”
<verse eID="Acts.19.27" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.19.28" osisID="Acts.19.28" n="28" />When they heard this, the men were greatly enraged, and began shouting – “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”
<verse eID="Acts.19.28" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.29" osisID="Acts.19.29" n="29" />The commotion spread through the whole city, and the people rushed together into the amphitheater, dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus, two Macedonians who were Paul’s traveling companions.
<verse eID="Acts.19.29" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.30" osisID="Acts.19.30" n="30" />Paul wished to go into the amphitheater and face the people, but the disciples would not let him,
<verse eID="Acts.19.30" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.31" osisID="Acts.19.31" n="31" />while some of the chief religious officials of the province, who were friendly to him, sent repeated entreaties to him not to trust himself inside.
<verse eID="Acts.19.31" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.32" osisID="Acts.19.32" n="32" />Meanwhile some were shouting one thing and some another, for the Assembly was all in confusion, most of those present not even knowing why they had met.
<verse eID="Acts.19.32" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.33" osisID="Acts.19.33" n="33" />But some of the crowd prompted Alexander, whom several of the Jewish leaders had pushed to the front, and he waved his hand to show that he wanted to speak in their defense to the people.
<verse eID="Acts.19.33" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.34" osisID="Acts.19.34" n="34" />However, when they recognized him as a Jew, one cry broke from them all, and they continued shouting for two hours – “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”
<verse eID="Acts.19.34" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.19.35" osisID="Acts.19.35" n="35" />When the Recorder had succeeded in quieting the crowd, he said, “People of Ephesus, who is there, I ask you, who needs to be told that this city of Ephesus is the Warden of the Temple of the great Artemis, and of the statue which fell down from Zeus?
<verse eID="Acts.19.35" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.36" osisID="Acts.19.36" n="36" />As these are undeniable facts, you ought to keep calm and do nothing rash;
<verse eID="Acts.19.36" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.37" osisID="Acts.19.37" n="37" />for you have brought these men here, though they are neither robbers of Temples nor blasphemers of our Goddess.
<verse eID="Acts.19.37" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.38" osisID="Acts.19.38" n="38" />If, however, Demetrius and the artisans who are acting with him have a charge to make against anyone, there are court days and there are Magistrates; let both parties take legal proceedings.
<verse eID="Acts.19.38" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.39" osisID="Acts.19.39" n="39" />But if you want anything more, it will have to be settled in the regular Assembly.
<verse eID="Acts.19.39" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.40" osisID="Acts.19.40" n="40" />For I tell you that we are in danger of being proceeded against for today’s riot, there being nothing to account for it; and in that case we will be at a loss to give any reason for this disorderly gathering.”
<verse eID="Acts.19.40" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.19.41" osisID="Acts.19.41" n="41" />With these words he dismissed the Assembly.
<verse eID="Acts.19.41" />
<chapter eID="Acts.19" />

<p>
<chapter sID="Acts.20" osisID="Acts.20" n="20" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.1" osisID="Acts.20.1" n="1" />When the uproar had ceased, Paul sent for the disciples, and, with encouraging words, bade them goodbye, and started on his journey to Macedonia.
<verse eID="Acts.20.1" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.2" osisID="Acts.20.2" n="2" />After going through those districts and speaking many encouraging words to the disciples, he went into Greece, where he stayed three months.
<verse eID="Acts.20.2" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.3" osisID="Acts.20.3" n="3" />He was about to sail to Syria, when he learned that a plot had been laid against him by several of the Jewish leaders; so he decided to return by way of Macedonia.
<verse eID="Acts.20.3" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.4" osisID="Acts.20.4" n="4" />He was accompanied by Sopater the son of Pyrrhus, of Beroea, Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy, as well as by Tychicus and Trophimus of Roman Asia.
<verse eID="Acts.20.4" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.5" osisID="Acts.20.5" n="5" />These people went to Troas and waited for us there;
<verse eID="Acts.20.5" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.6" osisID="Acts.20.6" n="6" />while we ourselves sailed from Philippi after the Passover, and joined them five days later at Troas, where we stayed for a week.
<verse eID="Acts.20.6" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.20.7" osisID="Acts.20.7" n="7" />On the first day of the week, when we had met for the breaking of bread, Paul, who was intending to leave the next day, began to address those who were present, and prolonged his address until midnight.
<verse eID="Acts.20.7" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.8" osisID="Acts.20.8" n="8" />There were a good many lamps in the upstairs room, where we had met;
<verse eID="Acts.20.8" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.9" osisID="Acts.20.9" n="9" />and a young man named Eutychus, sitting at the window, was gradually overcome with great drowsiness, as Paul continued his address. At last, quite overpowered by his drowsiness, he fell from the third story to the ground, and was picked up for dead.
<verse eID="Acts.20.9" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.10" osisID="Acts.20.10" n="10" />But Paul went down, threw himself on him, and put his arms around him.
</p>
<p>
“Do not be alarmed,” he said, “he is still alive.”
<verse eID="Acts.20.10" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.11" osisID="Acts.20.11" n="11" />Then he went upstairs; and, after breaking and partaking of the bread, he talked with them at great length until daybreak, and then left.
<verse eID="Acts.20.11" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.12" osisID="Acts.20.12" n="12" />Meanwhile they had taken the lad away alive, and were greatly comforted.
<verse eID="Acts.20.12" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.20.13" osisID="Acts.20.13" n="13" />We started first, went on board ship, and sailed for Assos, intending to take Paul on board there. This was by his own arrangement, as he intended to go by land himself.
<verse eID="Acts.20.13" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.14" osisID="Acts.20.14" n="14" />So, when he met us at Assos, we took him on board and went on to Mitylene.
<verse eID="Acts.20.14" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.15" osisID="Acts.20.15" n="15" />The day after we had sailed from there, we arrived off Chios, touched at Samos the following day, and the next day reached Miletus;
<verse eID="Acts.20.15" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.16" osisID="Acts.20.16" n="16" />for Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus, so as to avoid spending much time in Roman Asia. He was making haste to reach Jerusalem, if possible, by the Festival at the close of the Harvest.
<verse eID="Acts.20.16" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.20.17" osisID="Acts.20.17" n="17" />From Miletus, however, he sent to Ephesus and invited the church elders to meet him;
<verse eID="Acts.20.17" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.18" osisID="Acts.20.18" n="18" />and, when they came, he said to them, “You know well the life that I always led among you from the very first day that I set foot in Roman Asia,
<verse eID="Acts.20.18" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.19" osisID="Acts.20.19" n="19" />serving the Lord, as I did, in all humility, amid the tears and trials which fell to my lot through the plots of some of the Jewish leaders.
<verse eID="Acts.20.19" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.20" osisID="Acts.20.20" n="20" />I never shrank from telling you anything that could be helpful to you, or from teaching you both in public and in private.
<verse eID="Acts.20.20" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.21" osisID="Acts.20.21" n="21" />I earnestly pointed both Jews and Greeks to the repentance that leads to God, and to faith in Jesus, our Lord.
<verse eID="Acts.20.21" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.22" osisID="Acts.20.22" n="22" />And now, under spiritual constraint, I am here on my way to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there,
<verse eID="Acts.20.22" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.23" osisID="Acts.20.23" n="23" />except that in town after town the Holy Spirit plainly declares to me that imprisonment and troubles await me.
<verse eID="Acts.20.23" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.24" osisID="Acts.20.24" n="24" />But I count my life of no value to myself, if only I may complete the course marked out for me, and the task that was allotted me by the Lord Jesus – which was to declare the good news of the love of God.
<verse eID="Acts.20.24" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.25" osisID="Acts.20.25" n="25" />And now, I tell you, I know that none of you will ever see my face again – you among whom I have gone about proclaiming the kingdom.
<verse eID="Acts.20.25" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.26" osisID="Acts.20.26" n="26" />Therefore I declare to you this day, that my conscience is clear in regard to the fate of any of you,
<verse eID="Acts.20.26" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.27" osisID="Acts.20.27" n="27" />for I have not shrunk from announcing the whole purpose of God regarding you.
<verse eID="Acts.20.27" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.28" osisID="Acts.20.28" n="28" />Be watchful over yourselves, and over the whole flock, of which the Holy Spirit has placed you in charge, to shepherd the church of God, which he won for himself at the cost of his life.
<verse eID="Acts.20.28" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.29" osisID="Acts.20.29" n="29" />I know that, after my departure, merciless wolves will get in among you, who will not spare the flock;
<verse eID="Acts.20.29" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.30" osisID="Acts.20.30" n="30" />and from among yourselves, too, people will arise, who will teach perversions of truth, so as to draw away the disciples after them.
<verse eID="Acts.20.30" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.31" osisID="Acts.20.31" n="31" />Therefore, be on your guard, remembering how for three years, night and day, I never ceased, even with tears, to warn each one of you.
<verse eID="Acts.20.31" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.32" osisID="Acts.20.32" n="32" />And now I commend you to the Lord and to the message of his love – a message which has the power to build up your characters, and to give you your place among all those who have become Christ’s people.
<verse eID="Acts.20.32" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.33" osisID="Acts.20.33" n="33" />I have never coveted anyone’s gold or silver or clothing.
<verse eID="Acts.20.33" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.34" osisID="Acts.20.34" n="34" />You, yourselves, know that these hands of mine provided not only for my own wants, but for my companions also.
<verse eID="Acts.20.34" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.35" osisID="Acts.20.35" n="35" />I left nothing undone to show you that, laboring as I labored, you ought to help the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said himself – <q who="Jesus" marker="">‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’”</q>
<verse eID="Acts.20.35" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.36" osisID="Acts.20.36" n="36" />When Paul had finished speaking, he knelt down and prayed with them all.
<verse eID="Acts.20.36" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.37" osisID="Acts.20.37" n="37" />All were in tears; and throwing their arms around Paul’s neck, they kissed him again and again,
<verse eID="Acts.20.37" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.38" osisID="Acts.20.38" n="38" />grieving most of all over what he had said – that they would never see his face again. Then they escorted him to the ship.

<verse sID="Acts.21.1" osisID="Acts.21.1" n="1" />When we had torn ourselves away and had set sail, we ran before the wind to Cos; the next day we came to Rhodes, and from there to Patara,
<verse eID="Acts.21.1" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.2" osisID="Acts.21.2" n="2" />where we found a ship crossing to Phoenicia, and went on board and set sail.
<verse eID="Acts.21.2" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.3" osisID="Acts.21.3" n="3" />After sighting Cyprus and leaving it on the left, we sailed to Syria, and put into Tyre, where the ship was to discharge her cargo.
<verse eID="Acts.21.3" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.4" osisID="Acts.21.4" n="4" />There we found the disciples and stayed a week with them. Speaking under the influence of the Spirit, they warned Paul not to set foot in Jerusalem.
<verse eID="Acts.21.4" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.5" osisID="Acts.21.5" n="5" />However, when we had come to the end of our visit, we went on our way, all the disciples with their wives and children escorting us out of the city. We knelt down on the beach, and prayed,
<verse eID="Acts.21.5" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.6" osisID="Acts.21.6" n="6" />and then said goodbye to one another; after which we went on board, and they returned home.
<verse eID="Acts.21.6" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.21.7" osisID="Acts.21.7" n="7" />After we had made the run from Tyre, we landed at Ptolemais, and exchanged greetings with the followers there, and spent a day with them.
<verse eID="Acts.21.7" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.8" osisID="Acts.21.8" n="8" />The next day we left, and reached Caesarea, where we went to the house of Philip, the missionary, who was one of the Seven, and stayed with him.
<verse eID="Acts.21.8" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.9" osisID="Acts.21.9" n="9" />He had four unmarried daughters, who had the gift of prophecy.
<verse eID="Acts.21.9" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.10" osisID="Acts.21.10" n="10" />During our visit, which lasted several days, a prophet, named Agabus, came down from Judea.
<verse eID="Acts.21.10" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.11" osisID="Acts.21.11" n="11" />He came to see us, and, taking Paul’s belt, and binding his own feet and hands with it, said, “This is what the Holy Spirit says – ‘The man to whom this belt belongs will be bound like this by the religious authorities in Jerusalem, and they will give him up to the Gentiles’.”
<verse eID="Acts.21.11" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.12" osisID="Acts.21.12" n="12" />When we heard that, we and the people of the place began to entreat Paul not to go up to Jerusalem.
<verse eID="Acts.21.12" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.21.13" osisID="Acts.21.13" n="13" />It was then that Paul made the reply, “Why are you weeping and breaking my heart like this? For my part, I am ready not only to be bound, but even to suffer death at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.”
<verse eID="Acts.21.13" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.14" osisID="Acts.21.14" n="14" />So, as he would not be persuaded, we said no more to him, only adding – “The Lord’s will be done.”
<verse eID="Acts.21.14" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.21.15" osisID="Acts.21.15" n="15" />At the end of our visit, we made our preparations, and started on our way up to Jerusalem.

<verse sID="Acts.21.16" osisID="Acts.21.16" n="16" />Some of the disciples from Caesarea went with us, and brought Mnason with them, a Cypriot disciple of long standing, with whom we were to stay.

<verse sID="Acts.21.17" osisID="Acts.21.17" n="17" />On our arrival at Jerusalem, the followers of the Lord there gave us a hearty welcome;
<verse eID="Acts.21.17" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.18" osisID="Acts.21.18" n="18" />and the next day Paul went with us to see James, and all the church elders were present.

<verse sID="Acts.21.20" osisID="Acts.21.20" n="20" />and, when they had heard it, they began praising God, and said to Paul:
</p>
<p>
“You see, brother, that those of our people who have become believers in Christ may be numbered by tens of thousands, and they are all naturally earnest in upholding the Jewish Law.
<verse eID="Acts.21.20" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.21" osisID="Acts.21.21" n="21" />Now they have heard it said about you, that you teach all of our people in foreign countries to forsake Moses, for you tell them not to circumcise their children or even to observe Jewish customs.
<verse eID="Acts.21.21" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.22" osisID="Acts.21.22" n="22" />Well now, as they are certain to hear of your arrival, do what we are going to suggest.
<verse eID="Acts.21.22" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.23" osisID="Acts.21.23" n="23" />We have four men here, who have of their own accord put themselves under a vow.
<verse eID="Acts.21.23" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.24" osisID="Acts.21.24" n="24" />Join these men, share their purification, and bear their expenses, so that they may shave their heads; and then all will see that there is no truth in what they have been told about you, but that, on the contrary, you yourself rule your life in obedience to the Jewish Law.
<verse eID="Acts.21.24" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.25" osisID="Acts.21.25" n="25" />As to the Gentiles who have become believers in Christ, we have sent our decision that they should avoid food offered to idols, and blood, and the flesh of strangled animals, and impurity.”
<verse eID="Acts.21.25" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.21.26" osisID="Acts.21.26" n="26" />Paul joined the men, and the next day shared their purification, and went into the Temple, and gave notice of the expiration of the period of purification when the usual offering should have been made on behalf of each of them.
<verse eID="Acts.21.26" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.21.27" osisID="Acts.21.27" n="27" />But, just as the seven days were drawing to a close, some of the Jewish people from Roman Asia caught sight of Paul in the Temple, and caused great excitement among all the people present, by seizing Paul and shouting,
<verse eID="Acts.21.27" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.28" osisID="Acts.21.28" n="28" />“People of Israel! Help! This is the man who teaches everyone everywhere against our people, our Law, and this place; and, what is more, he has actually brought Greeks into the Temple and defiled this sacred place.”
<verse eID="Acts.21.28" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.29" osisID="Acts.21.29" n="29" />(For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in Paul’s company in the city, and were under the belief that Paul had taken him into the Temple.)
<verse eID="Acts.21.29" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.21.30" osisID="Acts.21.30" n="30" />The whole city was stirred, and the people quickly collected, seized Paul, and dragged him out of the Temple, when the doors were immediately shut.
<verse eID="Acts.21.30" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.31" osisID="Acts.21.31" n="31" />They were bent on killing him, when it was reported to the officer commanding the garrison, that all Jerusalem was in commotion.
<verse eID="Acts.21.31" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.32" osisID="Acts.21.32" n="32" />He instantly got together some officers and soldiers, and charged down on the crowd, who, when they saw the commanding officer and his soldiers, stopped beating Paul.
<verse eID="Acts.21.32" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.33" osisID="Acts.21.33" n="33" />Then he went up to Paul, arrested him, ordered him to be doubly chained, and proceeded to inquire who he was, and what he had been doing.
<verse eID="Acts.21.33" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.34" osisID="Acts.21.34" n="34" />Some of the crowd said one thing, and some another; and, as he could get no definite reply because of the uproar, he ordered Paul to be taken into the barracks.
<verse eID="Acts.21.34" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.35" osisID="Acts.21.35" n="35" />When Paul reached the steps, he was actually being carried by the soldiers, owing to the violence of the mob;
<verse eID="Acts.21.35" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.36" osisID="Acts.21.36" n="36" />for the people were following in a mass, shouting out, “Kill him!”
<verse eID="Acts.21.36" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.21.37" osisID="Acts.21.37" n="37" />Just as he was about to be taken into the Fort, Paul said to the commanding officer, “May I speak to you?”
</p>
<p>
“Do you know Greek?” asked the commanding officer.
<verse eID="Acts.21.37" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.38" osisID="Acts.21.38" n="38" />“Aren’t you, then, the Egyptian who some time ago raised an insurrection and led the four thousand Bandits out into the wilderness?”
<verse eID="Acts.21.38" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.21.39" osisID="Acts.21.39" n="39" />“No,” said Paul, “I am a Jew of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of a city of some note. I beg you to give me permission to speak to the people.”
<verse eID="Acts.21.39" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.21.40" osisID="Acts.21.40" n="40" />The commanding officer gave his permission, and Paul, standing on the steps, made signs with his hand to the people, and, when comparative silence had been obtained, he said to them in Hebrew:
<verse eID="Acts.21.40" />
<chapter eID="Acts.21" />
<chapter sID="Acts.22" osisID="Acts.22" n="22" />
<verse sID="Acts.22.1" osisID="Acts.22.1" n="1" />“Brothers and fathers, listen to the defense which I am about to make.”
<verse eID="Acts.22.1" />
<verse sID="Acts.22.2" osisID="Acts.22.2" n="2" />When they heard that he was speaking to them in Hebrew, they were still more quiet; and Paul went on:
<verse eID="Acts.22.2" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.22.3" osisID="Acts.22.3" n="3" />“I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, but I was brought up in this city under the teaching of Gamaliel, and educated in accordance with the strict system of our ancestral Law. I was as zealous in God’s service as any of you who are here today.
<verse eID="Acts.22.3" />
<verse sID="Acts.22.4" osisID="Acts.22.4" n="4" />In my persecution of this Way I did not stop even at the taking of life. I put in chains, and imprisoned, men and women alike –
<verse eID="Acts.22.4" />
<verse sID="Acts.22.5" osisID="Acts.22.5" n="5" />And to that the high priest himself and all the council of elders can testify. For I had letters of introduction from them to our fellow Jews at Damascus, and I was on my way to that place, to bring those whom I might find there prisoners to Jerusalem for punishment.
<verse eID="Acts.22.5" />
<verse sID="Acts.22.6" osisID="Acts.22.6" n="6" />While I was still on my way, just as I was getting close to Damascus, about midday, suddenly there flashed from the heavens a great light all around me.
<verse eID="Acts.22.6" />
<verse sID="Acts.22.7" osisID="Acts.22.7" n="7" />I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me <q who="Jesus" marker="">‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?’</q>
<verse eID="Acts.22.7" />
<verse sID="Acts.22.8" osisID="Acts.22.8" n="8" />‘Who are you, Lord?’ I replied. Then the voice said <q who="Jesus" marker="">‘I am Jesus of Nazareth whom you are persecuting.’</q>
<verse eID="Acts.22.8" />
<verse sID="Acts.22.9" osisID="Acts.22.9" n="9" />The men with me saw the light, but did not hear the speaker’s voice.
<verse eID="Acts.22.9" />
<verse sID="Acts.22.10" osisID="Acts.22.10" n="10" />Then I said ‘What am I to do, Lord?’ <q who="Jesus" marker="">‘Get up and go into Damascus,’</q>  The Lord said to me, <q who="Jesus" marker="">‘and there you will be told all that you have been appointed to do.’</q>
<verse eID="Acts.22.10" />
<verse sID="Acts.22.11" osisID="Acts.22.11" n="11" />In consequence of that dazzling light I could not see, but my companions held me by the hand, until I reached Damascus.
<verse eID="Acts.22.11" />
<verse sID="Acts.22.12" osisID="Acts.22.12" n="12" />There a man named Ananias, a strict observer of our Law, well spoken of by all the Jewish inhabitants, came to see me.
<verse eID="Acts.22.12" />
<verse sID="Acts.22.13" osisID="Acts.22.13" n="13" />Standing close to me, he said ‘Saul, my brother, recover your sight.’ And then and there I recovered my sight and looked up at him.
<verse eID="Acts.22.13" />
<verse sID="Acts.22.14" osisID="Acts.22.14" n="14" />Then he said ‘The God of our ancestors has appointed you to learn his will, and to see the righteous one, and to hear words from his lips;
<verse eID="Acts.22.14" />
<verse sID="Acts.22.15" osisID="Acts.22.15" n="15" />for you will be a witness for him to all the world of what you have just seen and heard.
<verse eID="Acts.22.15" />
<verse sID="Acts.22.16" osisID="Acts.22.16" n="16" />And now why wait any longer, Be baptized at once, wash away your sins, and invoke his name.’
<verse eID="Acts.22.16" />
<verse sID="Acts.22.17" osisID="Acts.22.17" n="17" />After my return to Jerusalem, while I was praying one day in the Temple, I fell into a trance,
<verse eID="Acts.22.17" />
<verse sID="Acts.22.18" osisID="Acts.22.18" n="18" />and saw Jesus saying to me <q who="Jesus" marker="">‘Make haste and leave Jerusalem at once, because they will not accept your testimony about me.’</q>
<verse eID="Acts.22.18" />
<verse sID="Acts.22.19" osisID="Acts.22.19" n="19" />‘Lord,’ I answered, ‘these people know that I used to imprison and scourge, in synagogue after synagogue, those who believed in you;
<verse eID="Acts.22.19" />
<verse sID="Acts.22.20" osisID="Acts.22.20" n="20" />and, when the blood of your martyr, Stephen, was being shed, I was myself standing by, approving of his death, and took charge of the clothes of those who were murdering him.’
<verse eID="Acts.22.20" />
<verse sID="Acts.22.21" osisID="Acts.22.21" n="21" />But Jesus said to me <q who="Jesus" marker="">‘Go; for I will send you to the Gentiles far away’.”</q>
<verse eID="Acts.22.21" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.22.22" osisID="Acts.22.22" n="22" />Up to this point the people had been listening to Paul, but at these words they called out, “Kill him! A fellow like this ought not to have been allowed to live!”
<verse eID="Acts.22.22" />
<verse sID="Acts.22.23" osisID="Acts.22.23" n="23" />As they were shouting, tearing off their clothes, and throwing dust in the air,
<verse eID="Acts.22.23" />
<verse sID="Acts.22.24" osisID="Acts.22.24" n="24" />the commanding officer ordered Paul to be taken into the Fort, and directed that he should be examined under the lash so that he might find out the reason for their outcry against him.
<verse eID="Acts.22.24" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.22.25" osisID="Acts.22.25" n="25" />But just as they had tied him up to be scourged, Paul said to the captain standing near, “Is it legal for you to scourge a Roman citizen, unconvicted?”
<verse eID="Acts.22.25" />
<verse sID="Acts.22.26" osisID="Acts.22.26" n="26" />On hearing this, the captain went and reported it to the commanding officer. “Do you know what you are doing?” he said. “This man is a Roman citizen.”
<verse eID="Acts.22.26" />
<verse sID="Acts.22.27" osisID="Acts.22.27" n="27" />So the commanding officer went up to Paul and said, “Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” replied Paul.
<verse eID="Acts.22.27" />
<verse sID="Acts.22.28" osisID="Acts.22.28" n="28" />“I had to pay a heavy price for my position as citizen,” said the officer. “I am one by birth,” rejoined Paul.
<verse eID="Acts.22.28" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.22.29" osisID="Acts.22.29" n="29" />The men who were to have examined Paul immediately drew back, and the officer, finding that Paul was a Roman citizen, was alarmed at having put him in chains.
<verse eID="Acts.22.29" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.22.30" osisID="Acts.22.30" n="30" />On the next day the commanding officer, wishing to find out the real reason why Paul was denounced by the Jewish leaders, had his chains taken off, and directed the chief priests and the whole of the High Council to assemble, and then took Paul down and brought him before them.
<verse eID="Acts.22.30" />
<chapter eID="Acts.22" />
<chapter sID="Acts.23" osisID="Acts.23" n="23" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.1" osisID="Acts.23.1" n="1" />Paul fixed his eyes on the Council, and began:
</p>
<p>
“Brothers, for my part, I have always ordered my life before God, with a clear conscience, up to this very day.”
<verse eID="Acts.23.1" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.2" osisID="Acts.23.2" n="2" />At this, the high priest Ananias ordered the men standing near to strike him on the mouth;
<verse eID="Acts.23.2" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.3" osisID="Acts.23.3" n="3" />Paul turned to him and said:
</p>
<p>
“God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! Are you sitting there to try me in accordance with law, and yet, in defiance of law, order me to be struck?”
<verse eID="Acts.23.3" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.4" osisID="Acts.23.4" n="4" />The people standing near said to Paul, “Do you know that you are insulting God’s high priest?”
<verse eID="Acts.23.4" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.23.5" osisID="Acts.23.5" n="5" />“I did not know, brothers, that it was the high priest,” said Paul, “for scripture says –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘Of the ruler of your people you should speak no ill’.” <verse eID="Acts.23.5" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Acts.23.6" osisID="Acts.23.6" n="6" />Noticing that some of those present were Sadducees and others Pharisees, Paul called out in the Council, “Brothers, I am a Pharisee and a son of Pharisees. It is on the question of hope for the dead and of their resurrection that I am on my trial.”
<verse eID="Acts.23.6" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.23.7" osisID="Acts.23.7" n="7" />As soon as he said this, a dispute arose between the Pharisees and the Sadducees; and there was a sharp division of opinion among those present.
<verse eID="Acts.23.7" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.8" osisID="Acts.23.8" n="8" />(For Sadducees say there is no such thing as a resurrection, and that there is neither angel nor spirit, while Pharisees believe in both.)
<verse eID="Acts.23.8" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.9" osisID="Acts.23.9" n="9" />So a great uproar ensued, and some of the Teachers of the Law belonging to the Pharisees’ party stood up and hotly protested, “We find nothing whatever wrong in this man. Suppose a spirit did speak to him, or an angel…”
<verse eID="Acts.23.9" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.10" osisID="Acts.23.10" n="10" />The dispute was becoming so violent, that the commanding officer, fearing that Paul would be torn in pieces between them, ordered the Guard to go down and rescue him from them, and take him into the Fort.
<verse eID="Acts.23.10" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.23.11" osisID="Acts.23.11" n="11" />That night the Lord came and stood by Paul, and said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">“Courage! You have borne witness for me in Jerusalem and you must bear witness in Rome also.”</q>
<verse eID="Acts.23.11" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.12" osisID="Acts.23.12" n="12" />In the morning some Jewish men combined together, and took an oath that they would not eat or drink until they had killed Paul.
<verse eID="Acts.23.12" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.13" osisID="Acts.23.13" n="13" />There were more than forty in the plot;
<verse eID="Acts.23.13" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.14" osisID="Acts.23.14" n="14" />and they went to the chief priests and the elders, and said, “We have taken a solemn oath not to touch food until we have killed Paul.
<verse eID="Acts.23.14" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.15" osisID="Acts.23.15" n="15" />So we want you now, with the consent of the Council, to suggest to the commanding officer that he should bring Paul down before you, as though you intended to go more fully into his case; but, before he comes here, we will be ready to make away with him.”
<verse eID="Acts.23.15" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.23.16" osisID="Acts.23.16" n="16" />However, the son of Paul’s sister, hearing of the plot, went to the Fort, and on being admitted, told Paul about it.
<verse eID="Acts.23.16" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.17" osisID="Acts.23.17" n="17" />Paul called one of the Captains of the garrison and asked him to take the lad to the commanding officer, as he had something to tell him.
<verse eID="Acts.23.17" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.18" osisID="Acts.23.18" n="18" />The captain went with the lad to the commanding officer, and said, “The prisoner Paul called me and asked me to bring this lad to you, as he has something to tell you.”
<verse eID="Acts.23.18" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.23.19" osisID="Acts.23.19" n="19" />The commanding officer took the lad by the hand, and, stepping aside, asked what it was he had to tell him.
<verse eID="Acts.23.19" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.20" osisID="Acts.23.20" n="20" />“Some men have agreed,” answered the lad, “to ask you to bring Paul down before the Council tomorrow, on the plea of your making further inquiry into his case.
<verse eID="Acts.23.20" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.21" osisID="Acts.23.21" n="21" />But do not let them persuade you, for more than forty of them are lying in wait for him, who have taken an oath that they will not eat or drink, until they have made away with him; and they are at this very moment in readiness, counting on your promise.”
<verse eID="Acts.23.21" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.22" osisID="Acts.23.22" n="22" />The commanding officer then dismissed the lad, cautioning him not to mention to anybody that he had given him that information.
<verse eID="Acts.23.22" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.23" osisID="Acts.23.23" n="23" />Then he called two Captains, and ordered them to have two hundred soldiers ready to go to Caesarea, as well as seventy troopers and two hundred lancers, by nine o’clock that night,
<verse eID="Acts.23.23" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.24" osisID="Acts.23.24" n="24" />and to have horses ready for Paul to ride, so that they might take him safely to Felix, the Governor.
<verse eID="Acts.23.24" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.25" osisID="Acts.23.25" n="25" />He also wrote a letter along these lines:

<verse sID="Acts.23.28" osisID="Acts.23.28" n="28" />Wanting to know exactly the ground of the charges they made against him, I brought him before their Council,

<verse eID="Acts.24.9" />
<verse sID="Acts.24.10" osisID="Acts.24.10" n="10" />On a sign from the Governor, Paul made this reply:
</p>
<p>
“Knowing, as I do, for how many years you have acted as judge to this nation, it is with confidence that I undertake my own defense.
<verse eID="Acts.24.10" />
<verse sID="Acts.24.11" osisID="Acts.24.11" n="11" />For you can easily verify that it is not more than twelve days ago that I went up to worship at Jerusalem,
<verse eID="Acts.24.11" />
<verse sID="Acts.24.12" osisID="Acts.24.12" n="12" />where my prosecutors never found me holding discussions with anyone, or causing a crowd to collect – either in the Temple, or in the synagogues, or about the city;
<verse eID="Acts.24.12" />
<verse sID="Acts.24.13" osisID="Acts.24.13" n="13" />and they cannot establish the charges which they are now making against me.
<verse eID="Acts.24.13" />
<verse sID="Acts.24.14" osisID="Acts.24.14" n="14" />This, however, I do acknowledge to you, that it is as a believer in the Way which they call heretical, that I worship the God of my ancestors. At the same time, I believe everything that is in accordance with the Law and that is written in the prophets;
<verse eID="Acts.24.14" />
<verse sID="Acts.24.15" osisID="Acts.24.15" n="15" />and I have a hope that rests in God – a hope which they also cherish – that there will one day be a resurrection of good and bad alike.
<verse eID="Acts.24.15" />
<verse sID="Acts.24.16" osisID="Acts.24.16" n="16" />This being so, I strive at all times to keep my conscience clear before both God and people.
<verse eID="Acts.24.16" />
<verse sID="Acts.24.17" osisID="Acts.24.17" n="17" />After some years’ absence I had come to bring charitable gifts to my nation, and to make offerings;
<verse eID="Acts.24.17" />
<verse sID="Acts.24.18" osisID="Acts.24.18" n="18" />and it was while engaged in this that they found me in the Temple, after completing a period of purification, but not with any crowd or disorder.
<verse eID="Acts.24.18" />
<verse sID="Acts.24.19" osisID="Acts.24.19" n="19" />There were, however, some Jews from Roman Asia who ought to have been here before you, and to have made any charge that they may have against me –
<verse eID="Acts.24.19" />
<verse sID="Acts.24.20" osisID="Acts.24.20" n="20" />Or else let my opponents here say what they found wrong in me when I was before the Council,
<verse eID="Acts.24.20" />
<verse sID="Acts.24.21" osisID="Acts.24.21" n="21" />except as to the one sentence that I shouted out as I stood among them – ‘It is about the resurrection of the dead that I am on my trial before you today’.”
<verse eID="Acts.24.21" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.24.22" osisID="Acts.24.22" n="22" />Felix, however, adjourned the case – though he had a fairly accurate knowledge of all that concerned the Way – with the promise, “When Lysias, the commanding officer, comes down, I will give my decision in your case.”
<verse eID="Acts.24.22" />
<verse sID="Acts.24.23" osisID="Acts.24.23" n="23" />So he gave orders to the captain in charge of Paul to keep him in custody, but to relax the regulations, and not to prevent any of his personal friends from attending to his wants.
<verse eID="Acts.24.23" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.24.24" osisID="Acts.24.24" n="24" />Some days later Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish, and, sending for Paul, listened to what he had to say about faith in Christ Jesus.
<verse eID="Acts.24.24" />
<verse sID="Acts.24.25" osisID="Acts.24.25" n="25" />But, while Paul was speaking at length about righteousness, self-control, and the coming judgment, Felix became terrified, and interrupted him – “Go for the present, but, when I find an opportunity, I will send for you again.”
<verse eID="Acts.24.25" />
<verse sID="Acts.24.26" osisID="Acts.24.26" n="26" />He was hoping, too, for a bribe from Paul, and so he used to send for him frequently and talk with him.
<verse eID="Acts.24.26" />
<verse sID="Acts.24.27" osisID="Acts.24.27" n="27" />But, after the lapse of two years, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and, wishing to gain popularity with the Jewish leaders, he left Paul a prisoner.
<verse eID="Acts.24.27" />
<chapter eID="Acts.24" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Acts.25" osisID="Acts.25" n="25" />
<verse sID="Acts.25.1" osisID="Acts.25.1" n="1" />Three days after Festus had arrived in his province, he left Caesarea and went up to Jerusalem.
<verse eID="Acts.25.1" />
<verse sID="Acts.25.2" osisID="Acts.25.2" n="2" />There the chief priests and the leading men among the Jews laid an information before him against Paul,
<verse eID="Acts.25.2" />
<verse sID="Acts.25.3" osisID="Acts.25.3" n="3" />and asked a favor of him, to Paul’s injury – to have Paul brought to Jerusalem. All the while they were plotting to make away with him on the road.
<verse eID="Acts.25.3" />
<verse sID="Acts.25.4" osisID="Acts.25.4" n="4" />But Festus answered that Paul was in prison at Caesarea, and that he himself would be leaving for that place shortly.
<verse eID="Acts.25.4" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.25.5" osisID="Acts.25.5" n="5" />“So let the influential men among you,” he said, “go down with me, and if there is anything amiss in the man, charge him formally with it.”
<verse eID="Acts.25.5" />
<verse sID="Acts.25.6" osisID="Acts.25.6" n="6" />After staying among them some eight or ten days, Festus went down to Caesarea. The next day he took his seat on the Bench, and ordered Paul to be brought before him.
<verse eID="Acts.25.6" />
<verse sID="Acts.25.7" osisID="Acts.25.7" n="7" />On Paul’s appearance, the Jewish leaders who had come down from Jerusalem surrounded him, and made many serious charges, which they failed to establish.
<verse eID="Acts.25.7" />
<verse sID="Acts.25.8" osisID="Acts.25.8" n="8" />Paul’s answer to the charge was – ‘I have not committed any offense against the Jewish Law, or the Temple, or the Emperor.’
<verse eID="Acts.25.8" />
<verse sID="Acts.25.9" osisID="Acts.25.9" n="9" />But, as Festus wished to gain popularity with the Jews, he interrupted Paul with the question, “Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and be tried on these charges before me there?”
<verse eID="Acts.25.9" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.25.10" osisID="Acts.25.10" n="10" />“No,” replied Paul, “I am standing at the Emperor’s court, where I ought to be tried. I have not wronged the Jews, as you yourself are well aware.
<verse eID="Acts.25.10" />
<verse sID="Acts.25.11" osisID="Acts.25.11" n="11" />If, however, I am breaking the law and have committed any offense deserving death, I do not ask to escape the penalty; but, if there is nothing in the accusations of these people, no one has the power to give me up to them. I appeal to the Emperor.”
<verse eID="Acts.25.11" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.25.12" osisID="Acts.25.12" n="12" />Festus, after conferring with his Council, answered, “You have appealed to the Emperor; to the Emperor you will go.”
<verse eID="Acts.25.12" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.25.13" osisID="Acts.25.13" n="13" />Some days later King Agrippa and Bernice came down to Caesarea, and paid a visit of congratulation to Festus;
<verse eID="Acts.25.13" />
<verse sID="Acts.25.14" osisID="Acts.25.14" n="14" />and, as they were staying there for several days, Festus laid Paul’s case before the king. “There is a man here,” he said, “left a prisoner by Felix,
<verse eID="Acts.25.14" />
<verse sID="Acts.25.15" osisID="Acts.25.15" n="15" />about whom, when I came to Jerusalem, the Jewish chief priest and the elders laid an information, demanding judgment against him.
<verse eID="Acts.25.15" />
<verse sID="Acts.25.16" osisID="Acts.25.16" n="16" />My answer to them was, that it was not the practice of Romans to give up anyone to their accusers until the accused had met them face to face, and had also had an opportunity of answering the charges brought against them.
<verse eID="Acts.25.16" />
<verse sID="Acts.25.17" osisID="Acts.25.17" n="17" />So they met here, and without loss of time I took my seat on the Bench the very next day, and ordered the man to be brought before me.
<verse eID="Acts.25.17" />
<verse sID="Acts.25.18" osisID="Acts.25.18" n="18" />But, when his accusers came forward, they brought no charge of wrong-doing such as I had expected;
<verse eID="Acts.25.18" />
<verse sID="Acts.25.19" osisID="Acts.25.19" n="19" />but I found that there were certain questions in dispute between them about their own religion, and about some dead man called Jesus, whom Paul declared to be alive.
<verse eID="Acts.25.19" />
<verse sID="Acts.25.20" osisID="Acts.25.20" n="20" />And, as I was at a loss how to enquire into questions of this kind, I asked Paul if he were willing to go up to Jerusalem, and be put on trial there.
<verse eID="Acts.25.20" />
<verse sID="Acts.25.21" osisID="Acts.25.21" n="21" />Paul, however, appealed to have his case reserved for the consideration of his August Majesty, so I ordered him to be detained in custody, until I could send him to the Emperor.”
<verse eID="Acts.25.21" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.25.22" osisID="Acts.25.22" n="22" />“I should like to hear this man myself,” Agrippa said to Festus.
</p>
<p>
“You will hear him tomorrow,” Festus answered.
<verse eID="Acts.25.22" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.25.23" osisID="Acts.25.23" n="23" />So the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice had come in full state and had entered the Audience Chamber, with the superior officers and the principal people of the city, by the order of Festus Paul was brought before them.
<verse eID="Acts.25.23" />
<verse sID="Acts.25.24" osisID="Acts.25.24" n="24" />Then Festus said, “King Agrippa, and all here present, you see before you the man about whom the whole Jewish people have applied to me, both at Jerusalem and here, loudly asserting that he ought not to be allowed to live.
<verse eID="Acts.25.24" />
<verse sID="Acts.25.25" osisID="Acts.25.25" n="25" />I found, however, that he had not done anything deserving death; so, as he had himself appealed to his August Majesty, I decided to send him.
<verse eID="Acts.25.25" />
<verse sID="Acts.25.26" osisID="Acts.25.26" n="26" />But I have nothing definite to write about him to my Imperial Master; and for that reason I have brought him before you all, and especially before you, King Agrippa, that, after examining him, I may have something to write.
<verse eID="Acts.25.26" />
<verse sID="Acts.25.27" osisID="Acts.25.27" n="27" />For it seems to me absurd to send a prisoner, without at the same time stating the charges made against him.”
<verse eID="Acts.25.27" />
<chapter eID="Acts.25" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Acts.26" osisID="Acts.26" n="26" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.1" osisID="Acts.26.1" n="1" />Turning to Paul, Agrippa said, “You are at liberty to speak for yourself.” Then Paul stretched out his hand and began his defense.
<verse eID="Acts.26.1" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.2" osisID="Acts.26.2" n="2" />“I have been congratulating myself, King Agrippa,” he said, “that it is before you that I have to make my defense today, with regard to all the charges brought against me by my own people,
<verse eID="Acts.26.2" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.3" osisID="Acts.26.3" n="3" />especially as you are so well-versed in all the customs and questions of the Jewish world. I beg you therefore to give me a patient hearing.
<verse eID="Acts.26.3" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.4" osisID="Acts.26.4" n="4" />My life, then, from youth upwards, was passed, from the very first, among my own nation, and in Jerusalem, and is within the knowledge of all Jews;
<verse eID="Acts.26.4" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.5" osisID="Acts.26.5" n="5" />and they have always known – if they choose to give evidence – that, in accordance with the very strictest form of our religion, I lived a true Pharisee.
<verse eID="Acts.26.5" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.6" osisID="Acts.26.6" n="6" />Even now, it is because of my hope in the promise given by God to our ancestors that I stand here on my trial –
<verse eID="Acts.26.6" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.7" osisID="Acts.26.7" n="7" />A promise which our twelve tribes, by earnest service night and day, hope to see fulfilled. It is for this hope, your Majesty, that I am accused – and by Jews themselves!
<verse eID="Acts.26.7" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.8" osisID="Acts.26.8" n="8" />Why do you all hold it incredible that God should raise the dead?
<verse eID="Acts.26.8" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.9" osisID="Acts.26.9" n="9" />I myself, it is true, once thought it my duty to oppose in every way the name of Jesus of Nazareth;
<verse eID="Acts.26.9" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.10" osisID="Acts.26.10" n="10" />and I actually did so at Jerusalem. Acting on the authority of the chief priests, I myself threw many of the people of Christ into prison, and, when it was proposed to put them to death, I gave my vote for it.
<verse eID="Acts.26.10" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.11" osisID="Acts.26.11" n="11" />Time after time, in every synagogue, I tried by punishments to force them to blaspheme. So frantic was I against them, that I pursued them even to towns beyond our borders.
<verse eID="Acts.26.11" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.12" osisID="Acts.26.12" n="12" />It was while I was traveling to Damascus on an errand of this kind, entrusted with full powers by the chief priests,
<verse eID="Acts.26.12" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.13" osisID="Acts.26.13" n="13" />that at midday, your Majesty, I saw right in my path, coming from the heavens, a light brighter than the glare of the sun, which shone all around me and those traveling with me.
<verse eID="Acts.26.13" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.14" osisID="Acts.26.14" n="14" />We all fell to the ground, and then I heard a voice saying to me in Hebrew – <q who="Jesus" marker="">‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? By kicking against the goad you are punishing yourself.’</q>
<verse eID="Acts.26.14" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.15" osisID="Acts.26.15" n="15" />‘Who are you, Lord?’ I asked. And the Lord said, <q who="Jesus" marker="">‘I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting;</q>
<verse eID="Acts.26.15" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.16" osisID="Acts.26.16" n="16" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">but get up and stand upright; for I have appeared to you in order to appoint you a servant and a witness of those revelations of me which you have already had, and of those in which I will yet appear to you,</q>
<verse eID="Acts.26.16" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.17" osisID="Acts.26.17" n="17" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">since I am choosing you out from your own people and from the Gentiles, to whom I now send you,</q>
<verse eID="Acts.26.17" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.18" osisID="Acts.26.18" n="18" /><q who="Jesus" marker="">to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God; so that they may receive pardon for their sins, and a place among those who have become God’s people, by faith in me.’</q>
<verse eID="Acts.26.18" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.19" osisID="Acts.26.19" n="19" />After that, King Agrippa, I did not fail to obey the heavenly vision;
<verse eID="Acts.26.19" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.20" osisID="Acts.26.20" n="20" />on the contrary, first to those at Damascus and Jerusalem, and then through the whole of Judea, and to the Gentiles as well, I began to preach repentance and conversion to God, and a life befitting that repentance.
<verse eID="Acts.26.20" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.21" osisID="Acts.26.21" n="21" />This is why some men seized me in the Temple, and made attempts on my life.
<verse eID="Acts.26.21" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.22" osisID="Acts.26.22" n="22" />However I have received help from God to this very day, and so stand here, and bear my testimony to high and low alike – without adding a word to what the prophets, as well as Moses, declared should happen –
<verse eID="Acts.26.22" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.23" osisID="Acts.26.23" n="23" />That the Christ must suffer, and that, by rising from the dead, he was destined to be the first to bring news of light, not only to our nation, but also to the Gentiles.”
<verse eID="Acts.26.23" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.26.24" osisID="Acts.26.24" n="24" />While Paul was making this defense, Festus called out loudly, “You are mad, Paul; your great learning is driving you mad.”
<verse eID="Acts.26.24" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.26.25" osisID="Acts.26.25" n="25" />“I am not mad, your Excellency,” he replied. “On the contrary, the statements that I am making are true and sober.
<verse eID="Acts.26.25" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.26" osisID="Acts.26.26" n="26" />Indeed, the king knows about these matters, so I speak before him without constraint. I am sure that there is nothing whatever of what I have been telling him that has escaped his attention; for all this has not been done in a corner.
<verse eID="Acts.26.26" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.27" osisID="Acts.26.27" n="27" />King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know you do.”
<verse eID="Acts.26.27" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.26.28" osisID="Acts.26.28" n="28" />But Agrippa said to Paul, “You are soon trying to make a Christian of me!”
<verse eID="Acts.26.28" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.26.29" osisID="Acts.26.29" n="29" />“Whether it is soon or late,” answered Paul, “I pray to God that not only you, but all who are listening to me, might today become just what I am myself – except for these chains!”
<verse eID="Acts.26.29" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.30" osisID="Acts.26.30" n="30" />Then the king rose, with the Governor and Bernice and those who had been sitting with them,
<verse eID="Acts.26.30" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.31" osisID="Acts.26.31" n="31" />and, after retiring, discussed the case among themselves. “There is nothing,” they said, “deserving death or imprisonment in this man’s conduct”;
<verse eID="Acts.26.31" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.32" osisID="Acts.26.32" n="32" />and, speaking to Festus, Agrippa added, “The man might have been discharged, if he had not appealed to the Emperor.”
<verse eID="Acts.26.32" />
<chapter eID="Acts.26" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Acts.27" osisID="Acts.27" n="27" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.1" osisID="Acts.27.1" n="1" />As it was decided that we were to sail to Italy, Paul and some other prisoners were put in charge of a captain of the Augustan Guard, named Julius.
<verse eID="Acts.27.1" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.2" osisID="Acts.27.2" n="2" />We went on board a ship from Adramyttium, which was on the point of sailing to the ports along the coast of Roman Asia, and put to sea. Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, went with us.
<verse eID="Acts.27.2" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.3" osisID="Acts.27.3" n="3" />The next day we put in to Sidon, where Julius treated Paul in a friendly manner, and allowed him to go to see his friends and receive their hospitality.
<verse eID="Acts.27.3" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.4" osisID="Acts.27.4" n="4" />Putting to sea again, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the wind was against us;
<verse eID="Acts.27.4" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.5" osisID="Acts.27.5" n="5" />and, after crossing the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we reached Myra in Lycia.
<verse eID="Acts.27.5" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.6" osisID="Acts.27.6" n="6" />There the Roman officer found an Alexandrian ship on her way to Italy, and put us on board of her.
<verse eID="Acts.27.6" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.7" osisID="Acts.27.7" n="7" />For several days our progress was slow, and it was only with difficulty that we arrived off Cnidus. As the wind was still unfavorable when we came off Cape Salmone, we sailed under the lee of Crete,
<verse eID="Acts.27.7" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.8" osisID="Acts.27.8" n="8" />and with difficulty, by keeping close in shore, we reached a place called ‘Fair Havens,’ near which was the town of Lasea.
<verse eID="Acts.27.8" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.27.9" osisID="Acts.27.9" n="9" />This had taken a considerable time, and sailing was already dangerous, for the Fast was already over; and so Paul gave this warning.
<verse eID="Acts.27.9" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.10" osisID="Acts.27.10" n="10" />“My friends,” he said, “I see that this voyage will be attended with injury and much damage, not only to the cargo and the ship, but to our own lives also.”
<verse eID="Acts.27.10" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.27.11" osisID="Acts.27.11" n="11" />The Roman officer, however, was more influenced by the captain and the owner than by what was said by Paul.
<verse eID="Acts.27.11" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.12" osisID="Acts.27.12" n="12" />And, as the harbor was not a suitable one to winter in, the majority were in favor of continuing the voyage, in hope of being able to reach Phoenix, and winter there. Phoenix was a Cretan harbor, open to the north-east and south-east.
<verse eID="Acts.27.12" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.13" osisID="Acts.27.13" n="13" />So, when a light wind sprang up from the south, thinking that they had found their opportunity, they weighed anchor and kept along the coast of Crete, close in shore.
<verse eID="Acts.27.13" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.14" osisID="Acts.27.14" n="14" />But shortly afterward a hurricane came down on us off the land – a north-easter, as it is called.
<verse eID="Acts.27.14" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.15" osisID="Acts.27.15" n="15" />The ship was caught by it and was unable to keep her head to the wind, so we had to give way and let her drive before it.
<verse eID="Acts.27.15" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.16" osisID="Acts.27.16" n="16" />Running under the lee of a small island called Cauda, we only just managed to secure the ship’s boat,
<verse eID="Acts.27.16" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.17" osisID="Acts.27.17" n="17" />and, after hoisting it on board, the men frapped the ship. But, afraid of being driven on to the Syrtis Sands, they lowered the yard, and then drifted.
<verse eID="Acts.27.17" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.18" osisID="Acts.27.18" n="18" />So violently were we tossed about by the storm, that the next day they began throwing the cargo overboard,
<verse eID="Acts.27.18" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.19" osisID="Acts.27.19" n="19" />and, on the following day, threw out the ship’s tackle with their own hands.
<verse eID="Acts.27.19" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.20" osisID="Acts.27.20" n="20" />As neither sun nor stars were visible for several days, and, as the gale still continued severe, all hope of our being saved was at last abandoned.
<verse eID="Acts.27.20" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.27.21" osisID="Acts.27.21" n="21" />It was then, when they had gone a long time without food, that Paul came forward, and said, “My friends, you should have listened to me, and not have sailed from Crete and so incurred this injury and damage.
<verse eID="Acts.27.21" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.22" osisID="Acts.27.22" n="22" />Yet, even as things are, I beg you not to lose courage, for there will not be a single life lost among you – only the ship.
<verse eID="Acts.27.22" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.23" osisID="Acts.27.23" n="23" />For last night an angel of the God to whom I belong, and whom I serve, stood by me, and said –
<verse eID="Acts.27.23" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.24" osisID="Acts.27.24" n="24" />‘Have no fear, Paul; you must appear before the Emperor, and God himself has given you the lives of all your fellow voyagers.’
<verse eID="Acts.27.24" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.25" osisID="Acts.27.25" n="25" />Therefore, courage, my friends! For I believe God, that everything will happen exactly as I have been told.
<verse eID="Acts.27.25" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.26" osisID="Acts.27.26" n="26" />We will, however, have to be driven on some island.”
<verse eID="Acts.27.26" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.27.27" osisID="Acts.27.27" n="27" />It was now the fourteenth night of the storm, and we were drifting about in the Adriatic Sea, when, about midnight, the sailors began to suspect that they were drawing near land.
<verse eID="Acts.27.27" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.28" osisID="Acts.27.28" n="28" />So they took soundings, and found twenty fathoms of water. After waiting a little, they took soundings again, and found fifteen fathoms.
<verse eID="Acts.27.28" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.29" osisID="Acts.27.29" n="29" />Then, as they were afraid of our being driven on some rocky coast, they let go four anchors from the stern, and longed for daylight.
<verse eID="Acts.27.29" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.30" osisID="Acts.27.30" n="30" />The sailors wanted to leave the ship, and had lowered the boat, on pretense of running out anchors from the bows,
<verse eID="Acts.27.30" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.31" osisID="Acts.27.31" n="31" />when Paul said to the Roman officer and his men, “Unless the sailors remain on board, you cannot be saved.”
<verse eID="Acts.27.31" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.32" osisID="Acts.27.32" n="32" />So the soldiers cut the ropes which held the boat, and let her drift away.
<verse eID="Acts.27.32" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.33" osisID="Acts.27.33" n="33" />In the interval before daybreak Paul kept urging them all to take something to eat.
</p>
<p>
“It is a fortnight today,” he said, “that, owing to your anxiety, you have gone without food, taking nothing.
<verse eID="Acts.27.33" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.34" osisID="Acts.27.34" n="34" />So I beg you to take something to eat; your safety depends on it, for not one of you will lose even a hair of his head.”
<verse eID="Acts.27.34" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.35" osisID="Acts.27.35" n="35" />With these words he took some bread, and, after saying the thanksgiving to God before them all, broke it in pieces, and began to eat;
<verse eID="Acts.27.35" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.36" osisID="Acts.27.36" n="36" />and the men all felt cheered and had something to eat themselves.
<verse eID="Acts.27.36" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.37" osisID="Acts.27.37" n="37" />There were about seventy-six of us on board, all told.
<verse eID="Acts.27.37" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.38" osisID="Acts.27.38" n="38" />After satisfying their hunger, they further lightened the ship by throwing the grain into the sea.
<verse eID="Acts.27.38" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.39" osisID="Acts.27.39" n="39" />When daylight came, they could not make out what land it was, but, observing a creek in which there was a beach, they consulted as to whether they could run the ship safely into it.
<verse eID="Acts.27.39" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.40" osisID="Acts.27.40" n="40" />Then they cast off, and abandoned the anchors, and at the same time unlashed the gear of the steering oars, hoisted the foresail to the wind, and made for the beach.
<verse eID="Acts.27.40" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.41" osisID="Acts.27.41" n="41" />They got, however, into a kind of channel, and there ran the ship aground. The bows stuck fast and could not be moved, while the stern began breaking up under the strain.
<verse eID="Acts.27.41" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.42" osisID="Acts.27.42" n="42" />The advice of the soldiers was that the prisoners should be killed, so that none of them could swim away and make their escape.
<verse eID="Acts.27.42" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.43" osisID="Acts.27.43" n="43" />But the Roman officer, anxious to save Paul, prevented their carrying out their intention, and ordered that those who could swim should be the first to jump into the sea and try to reach the shore;
<verse eID="Acts.27.43" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.44" osisID="Acts.27.44" n="44" />and that the rest should follow, some on planks, and others on different pieces of the ship. In these various ways everyone managed to get safely ashore.
<verse eID="Acts.27.44" />

<p>
<chapter sID="Acts.28" osisID="Acts.28" n="28" />
<verse sID="Acts.28.1" osisID="Acts.28.1" n="1" />When we were all safe, we found that the island was called Malta.
<verse eID="Acts.28.1" />
<verse sID="Acts.28.2" osisID="Acts.28.2" n="2" />The island’s people showed us marked kindness, for they lit a fire and took us all under shelter, because it had come on to rain and was cold.
<verse eID="Acts.28.2" />
<verse sID="Acts.28.3" osisID="Acts.28.3" n="3" />Paul had gathered a quantity of dry sticks and laid them on the fire, when a poisonous snake, driven out by the heat, fastened on his hand.
<verse eID="Acts.28.3" />
<verse sID="Acts.28.4" osisID="Acts.28.4" n="4" />When the islanders saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another, “Evidently this man is a murderer, for though he has been saved from the sea, Justice has not allowed him to live.”
<verse eID="Acts.28.4" />
<verse sID="Acts.28.5" osisID="Acts.28.5" n="5" />However, Paul shook the creature off into the fire and took no harm.
<verse eID="Acts.28.5" />
<verse sID="Acts.28.6" osisID="Acts.28.6" n="6" />The islanders were expecting inflammation to set in, or that he would suddenly fall dead; but, after waiting for a long time, and seeing that there was nothing amiss with him, they changed their minds and said that he was a God.
<verse eID="Acts.28.6" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.28.7" osisID="Acts.28.7" n="7" />In that region there was an estate belonging to the Governor of the island, whose name was Publius. He took us up to his house, and for three days entertained us most courteously.
<verse eID="Acts.28.7" />
<verse sID="Acts.28.8" osisID="Acts.28.8" n="8" />It happened that the father of Publius was lying ill of fever and dysentery. So Paul went to see him; and, after praying, he placed his hands on him and cured him.
<verse eID="Acts.28.8" />
<verse sID="Acts.28.9" osisID="Acts.28.9" n="9" />After this, all the people in the island who had any illness came to Paul, and were cured.
<verse eID="Acts.28.9" />
<verse sID="Acts.28.10" osisID="Acts.28.10" n="10" />They also presented us with many gifts, and when we set sail they put supplies of necessaries on board.
<verse eID="Acts.28.10" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.28.11" osisID="Acts.28.11" n="11" />After three months, we set sail in a ship that had wintered in the island. She was an Alexandrian vessel, and had the Twin sons of Zeus for her figure-head.
<verse eID="Acts.28.11" />
<verse sID="Acts.28.12" osisID="Acts.28.12" n="12" />We put in at Syracuse and stayed there three days,
<verse eID="Acts.28.12" />
<verse sID="Acts.28.13" osisID="Acts.28.13" n="13" />and from there we worked to windward and so got to Rhegium. A day later a south wind sprang up and took us to Puteoli in two days.
<verse eID="Acts.28.13" />
<verse sID="Acts.28.14" osisID="Acts.28.14" n="14" />There we found some of the Lord’s followers, and were urged to stay a week with them; after which we went on to Rome.
<verse eID="Acts.28.14" />
<verse sID="Acts.28.15" osisID="Acts.28.15" n="15" />The followers there had heard about us, and came out as far as the Market of Appius and the Three Taverns to meet us. At sight of them Paul thanked God and was much cheered.
<verse eID="Acts.28.15" />
<verse sID="Acts.28.16" osisID="Acts.28.16" n="16" />On our reaching Rome, Paul was allowed to live by himself, except for the soldier who was in charge of him.
<verse eID="Acts.28.16" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.28.17" osisID="Acts.28.17" n="17" />Three days after our arrival, Paul invited the leading Jews to meet him; and, when they came, he said, “Brothers, although I had done nothing hostile to the interests of our nation or to our ancestral customs, yet I was sent from Jerusalem as a prisoner, and handed over to the Romans.
<verse eID="Acts.28.17" />
<verse sID="Acts.28.18" osisID="Acts.28.18" n="18" />The Romans, when they had examined me, were ready to release me, because there was nothing in my conduct deserving death.
<verse eID="Acts.28.18" />
<verse sID="Acts.28.19" osisID="Acts.28.19" n="19" />But, as the Jewish leaders opposed my release, I was compelled to appeal to the Emperor – not, indeed, that I had any charge to make against my own nation.
<verse eID="Acts.28.19" />
<verse sID="Acts.28.20" osisID="Acts.28.20" n="20" />This, then, is my reason for urging you to come to see me and talk with me; because it is for the sake of the hope of Israel that I am here in chains.”
<verse eID="Acts.28.20" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.28.21" osisID="Acts.28.21" n="21" />“We,” was their reply, “have not had any letter about you from Judea, nor have any of our fellow Jews come and reported or said anything bad about you.
<verse eID="Acts.28.21" />
<verse sID="Acts.28.22" osisID="Acts.28.22" n="22" />But we will be glad to hear from you what your views are, for, with regard to this sect, we are well aware that it is spoken against on all sides.”
<verse eID="Acts.28.22" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Acts.28.23" osisID="Acts.28.23" n="23" />They then fixed a day with him, and came to the place where he was staying, in even larger numbers, when Paul proceeded to lay the subject before them. He bore his testimony to the kingdom of God, and tried to convince them about Jesus, by arguments drawn from the Law of Moses and from the prophets – speaking from morning until evening.
<verse eID="Acts.28.23" />
<verse sID="Acts.28.24" osisID="Acts.28.24" n="24" />Some were inclined to accept what he said; others, however, rejected it.
<verse eID="Acts.28.24" />
<verse sID="Acts.28.25" osisID="Acts.28.25" n="25" />So, as they disagreed among themselves, they began to disperse, Paul adding only –
</p>
<p>
“True, indeed, was the declaration made by the Holy Spirit, through the prophet Isaiah to your ancestors –

<p>
<verse sID="Acts.28.30" osisID="Acts.28.30" n="30" />For two whole years Paul stayed in a house which he rented for himself, welcoming all who came to see him,
<verse eID="Acts.28.30" />
<verse sID="Acts.28.31" osisID="Acts.28.31" n="31" />proclaiming the kingdom of God, and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ, with perfect fearlessness, unhindered.

<chapter sID="Rom.1" osisID="Rom.1" n="1" />
<!-- s --><title>Introduction</title>
<p>
<verse sID="Rom.1.1" osisID="Rom.1.1" n="1" />From Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, who has been called to become an apostle, and has been set apart to tell God’s good news.
<verse eID="Rom.1.1" />
<verse sID="Rom.1.2" osisID="Rom.1.2" n="2" />This good news God promised long ago through his prophets in the sacred scriptures,
<verse eID="Rom.1.2" />
<verse sID="Rom.1.3" osisID="Rom.1.3" n="3" />concerning his Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord; who, as to his human nature, was descended from David,
<verse eID="Rom.1.3" />
<verse sID="Rom.1.4" osisID="Rom.1.4" n="4" />but, as to the spirit of holiness within him, was miraculously designated Son of God by his resurrection from the dead.
<verse eID="Rom.1.4" />
<verse sID="Rom.1.5" osisID="Rom.1.5" n="5" />Through him we received the gift of the apostolic office, to win submission to the faith among all nations for the glory of his name.
<verse eID="Rom.1.5" />
<verse sID="Rom.1.6" osisID="Rom.1.6" n="6" />And among these nations are you – you who have been called to belong to Jesus Christ.
<verse eID="Rom.1.6" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rom.1.7" osisID="Rom.1.7" n="7" />To all in Rome who are dear to God and have been called to become Christ’s people, may God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace.
<verse eID="Rom.1.7" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rom.1.8" osisID="Rom.1.8" n="8" />First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, because the report of your faith is spreading throughout the world.
<verse eID="Rom.1.8" />
<verse sID="Rom.1.9" osisID="Rom.1.9" n="9" />God, to whom I offer the worship of my soul as I tell the goodness of his Son, is my witness how constantly I mention you when I pray,
<verse eID="Rom.1.9" />
<verse sID="Rom.1.10" osisID="Rom.1.10" n="10" />asking that, if he be willing, I may some day at last find the way open to visit you.
<verse eID="Rom.1.10" />
<verse sID="Rom.1.11" osisID="Rom.1.11" n="11" />For I long to see you, in order to impart to you some spiritual gift and so give you fresh strength –
<verse eID="Rom.1.11" />
<verse sID="Rom.1.12" osisID="Rom.1.12" n="12" />or rather that both you and I may find encouragement in each other’s faith.
<verse eID="Rom.1.12" />
<verse sID="Rom.1.13" osisID="Rom.1.13" n="13" />I want you to know, my friends, that I have many times intended coming to see you – but until now I have been prevented – that I might find among you some fruit of my labors, as I have already among the other nations.
</p>
<verse eID="Rom.1.13" />
<!-- s --><title>Faith the Ground of Acceptance</title>
<p>
<verse sID="Rom.1.14" osisID="Rom.1.14" n="14" />I have a duty to both the Greek and the barbarian, to both the cultured and the ignorant.
<verse eID="Rom.1.14" />
<verse sID="Rom.1.15" osisID="Rom.1.15" n="15" />And so, for my part, I am ready to tell the good news to you also who are in Rome.
<verse eID="Rom.1.15" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rom.1.16" osisID="Rom.1.16" n="16" />For I am not ashamed of the good news; it is the power of God which brings salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first, but also to the Greek.
<verse eID="Rom.1.16" />
<verse sID="Rom.1.17" osisID="Rom.1.17" n="17" />For in it there is a revelation of the divine righteousness resulting from faith and leading on to faith; as scripture says – ‘Through faith the righteous will find life.’
<verse eID="Rom.1.17" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rom.1.18" osisID="Rom.1.18" n="18" />So, too, there is a revelation from heaven of the divine wrath against every form of ungodliness and wickedness on the part of those people who, by their wicked lives, are stifling the truth.
<verse eID="Rom.1.18" />
<verse sID="Rom.1.19" osisID="Rom.1.19" n="19" />This is so, because what can be known about God is plain to them; for God himself has made it plain.
<verse eID="Rom.1.19" />
<verse sID="Rom.1.20" osisID="Rom.1.20" n="20" />For ever since the creation of the universe God’s invisible attributes – his everlasting power and divinity – are to be seen and studied in his works, so that people have no excuse;
<verse eID="Rom.1.20" />
<verse sID="Rom.1.21" osisID="Rom.1.21" n="21" />because, although they learned to know God, yet they did not offer him as God either praise or thanksgiving. Their speculations about him proved futile, and their undiscerning minds were darkened.
<verse eID="Rom.1.21" />
<verse sID="Rom.1.22" osisID="Rom.1.22" n="22" />Professing to be wise, they showed themselves fools;
<verse eID="Rom.1.22" />
<verse sID="Rom.1.23" osisID="Rom.1.23" n="23" />and they transformed the glory of the immortal God into the likeness of mortal humans, and of birds, and beasts, and reptiles.
<verse eID="Rom.1.23" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rom.1.24" osisID="Rom.1.24" n="24" />Therefore God abandoned them to impurity, letting them follow the cravings of their hearts, until they dishonored their own bodies;
<verse eID="Rom.1.24" />
<verse sID="Rom.1.25" osisID="Rom.1.25" n="25" />for they had substituted a lie for the truth about God, and had reverenced and worshiped created things more than the Creator, who is to be praised for ever. Amen.
<verse eID="Rom.1.25" />
<verse sID="Rom.1.26" osisID="Rom.1.26" n="26" />That, I say, is why God abandoned them to degrading passions. Even the women among them perverted the natural use of their bodies to the unnatural;
<verse eID="Rom.1.26" />
<verse sID="Rom.1.27" osisID="Rom.1.27" n="27" />while the men, disregarding that for which women were intended by nature, were consumed with passion for one another. Men indulged in vile practices with men, and incurred in their own persons the inevitable penalty for their perverseness.
<verse eID="Rom.1.27" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rom.1.28" osisID="Rom.1.28" n="28" />Then, as they would not keep God before their minds, God abandoned them to depraved thoughts, so that they did all kinds of shameful things.
<verse eID="Rom.1.28" />
<verse sID="Rom.1.29" osisID="Rom.1.29" n="29" />They reveled in every form of wickedness, evil, greed, vice. Their lives were full of envy, murder, quarreling, treachery, malice.
<verse eID="Rom.1.29" />
<verse sID="Rom.1.30" osisID="Rom.1.30" n="30" />They became back-biters, slanderers, impious, insolent, boastful. They devised new sins. They disobeyed their parents.
<verse eID="Rom.1.30" />
<verse sID="Rom.1.31" osisID="Rom.1.31" n="31" />They were undiscerning, untrustworthy, without natural affection or pity.
<verse eID="Rom.1.31" />
<verse sID="Rom.1.32" osisID="Rom.1.32" n="32" />Well aware of God’s decree, that those who do such things deserve to die, not only are they guilty of them themselves, but they even applaud those who do them.
<verse eID="Rom.1.32" />
<chapter eID="Rom.1" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Rom.2" osisID="Rom.2" n="2" />
<verse sID="Rom.2.1" osisID="Rom.2.1" n="1" />Therefore you have nothing to say in your own defense, whoever you are who set yourself up as a judge. In judging others you condemn yourself, for you who set yourself up as a judge do the very same things.
<verse eID="Rom.2.1" />
<verse sID="Rom.2.2" osisID="Rom.2.2" n="2" />And we know that God’s judgment falls unerringly on those who do them.
<verse eID="Rom.2.2" />
<verse sID="Rom.2.3" osisID="Rom.2.3" n="3" />You who judge those that do such things and yet are yourself guilty of them – do you suppose that you of all people will escape God’s judgment?
<verse eID="Rom.2.3" />
<verse sID="Rom.2.4" osisID="Rom.2.4" n="4" />Or do you think lightly of his abundant kindness, patience, and forbearance, not realizing that his kindness is meant to lead you to repentance?
<verse eID="Rom.2.4" />
<verse sID="Rom.2.5" osisID="Rom.2.5" n="5" />Hard-hearted and impenitent as you are, you are storing up for yourself wrath on the day of wrath, when God’s justice as a judge will be revealed;
<verse eID="Rom.2.5" />
<verse sID="Rom.2.6" osisID="Rom.2.6" n="6" />for he will give to everyone what their actions deserve.
<verse eID="Rom.2.6" />
<verse sID="Rom.2.7" osisID="Rom.2.7" n="7" />To those who, by perseverance in doing good, aim at glory, honor, and all that is imperishable, he will give immortal life;
<verse eID="Rom.2.7" />
<verse sID="Rom.2.8" osisID="Rom.2.8" n="8" />while as to those who are factious, and disobedient to truth but obedient to evil, wrath and anger, distress and despair,
<verse eID="Rom.2.8" />
<verse sID="Rom.2.9" osisID="Rom.2.9" n="9" />will fall on every human being who persists in wrong-doing – on the Jew first, but also on the Greek.
<verse eID="Rom.2.9" />
<verse sID="Rom.2.10" osisID="Rom.2.10" n="10" />But there will be glory, honor, and peace for everyone who does right – for the Jew first, but also for the Greek,
<verse eID="Rom.2.10" />
<verse sID="Rom.2.11" osisID="Rom.2.11" n="11" />since God shows no partiality.
<verse eID="Rom.2.11" />
<verse sID="Rom.2.12" osisID="Rom.2.12" n="12" />All who, when they sin, are without Law will also perish without Law; while all who, when they sin, are under Law, will be judged as being under Law.
<verse eID="Rom.2.12" />
<verse sID="Rom.2.13" osisID="Rom.2.13" n="13" />It is not those who hear the words of a Law that are righteous before God, but it is those who obey it that will be pronounced righteous.
<verse eID="Rom.2.13" />
<verse sID="Rom.2.14" osisID="Rom.2.14" n="14" />When Gentiles, who have no Law, do instinctively what the Law requires, they, though they have no Law, are a Law to themselves;
<verse eID="Rom.2.14" />
<verse sID="Rom.2.15" osisID="Rom.2.15" n="15" />for they show the demands of the Law written on their hearts; their consciences corroborating it, while in their thoughts they argue either in self-accusation or, it may be, in self-defense –
<verse eID="Rom.2.15" />
<verse sID="Rom.2.16" osisID="Rom.2.16" n="16" />on the day when God passes judgment on people’s inmost lives, as the good news that I tell declares that he will do through Christ Jesus.
<verse eID="Rom.2.16" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rom.2.17" osisID="Rom.2.17" n="17" />But, perhaps, you bear the name of ‘Jew,’ and are relying on Law, and boast of belonging to God, and understand his will,
<verse eID="Rom.2.17" />
<verse sID="Rom.2.18" osisID="Rom.2.18" n="18" />and, having been carefully instructed from the Law, have learned to appreciate the finer moral distinctions.
<verse eID="Rom.2.18" />
<verse sID="Rom.2.19" osisID="Rom.2.19" n="19" />Perhaps you are confident that you are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in the dark, an instructor of the unintelligent,
<verse eID="Rom.2.19" />
<verse sID="Rom.2.20" osisID="Rom.2.20" n="20" />and a teacher of the childish, because in the Law you possess the outline of all knowledge and truth.
<verse eID="Rom.2.20" />
<verse sID="Rom.2.21" osisID="Rom.2.21" n="21" />Why, then, you teacher of others, don’t you teach yourself? Do you preach against stealing, and yet steal?
<verse eID="Rom.2.21" />
<verse sID="Rom.2.22" osisID="Rom.2.22" n="22" />Do you forbid adultery, and yet commit adultery? Do you loathe idols, and yet plunder temples?
<verse eID="Rom.2.22" />
<verse sID="Rom.2.23" osisID="Rom.2.23" n="23" />Boasting, as you do, of your Law, do you dishonor God by breaking the Law?
<verse eID="Rom.2.23" />
<verse sID="Rom.2.24" osisID="Rom.2.24" n="24" />For, as scripture says – ‘The Gentiles insult God’s name because of you’!
<verse eID="Rom.2.24" />
<verse sID="Rom.2.25" osisID="Rom.2.25" n="25" />Circumcision has its value, if you are obeying the Law. But, if you are a breaker of the Law, your circumcision is no better than uncircumcision.
<verse eID="Rom.2.25" />
<verse sID="Rom.2.26" osisID="Rom.2.26" n="26" />If, then, an uncircumcised man pays regard to the requirements of the Law, won’t he, although not circumcised, be regarded by God as if he were?
<verse eID="Rom.2.26" />
<verse sID="Rom.2.27" osisID="Rom.2.27" n="27" />Indeed, the person who, owing to his birth, remains uncircumcised, and yet scrupulously obeys the Law, will condemn you, who, for all your written Law and your circumcision, are yet a breaker of the Law.
<verse eID="Rom.2.27" />
<verse sID="Rom.2.28" osisID="Rom.2.28" n="28" />For a man who is only a Jew outwardly is not a real Jew; nor is outward bodily circumcision real circumcision. The real Jew is the person who is a Jew in soul;
<verse eID="Rom.2.28" />
<verse sID="Rom.2.29" osisID="Rom.2.29" n="29" />and the real circumcision is the circumcision of the heart, a spiritual and not a literal thing. Such a person wins praise from God, though not from people.
<verse eID="Rom.2.29" />
<chapter eID="Rom.2" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Rom.3" osisID="Rom.3" n="3" />
<verse sID="Rom.3.1" osisID="Rom.3.1" n="1" />What is the advantage, then, of being a Jew? Or what is the good of circumcision?
<verse eID="Rom.3.1" />
<verse sID="Rom.3.2" osisID="Rom.3.2" n="2" />Great in every way. First of all, because the Jews were entrusted with God’s utterances.
<verse eID="Rom.3.2" />
<verse sID="Rom.3.3" osisID="Rom.3.3" n="3" />What follows then? Some, no doubt, showed a want of faith; but will their want of faith make God break faith? Heaven forbid!
<verse eID="Rom.3.3" />
<verse sID="Rom.3.4" osisID="Rom.3.4" n="4" />God must prove true, though everyone prove a liar! As scripture says of God – ‘That you may be pronounced righteous in what you say, and gain your cause when people would judge you.’
<verse eID="Rom.3.4" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rom.3.5" osisID="Rom.3.5" n="5" />But what if our wrong-doing makes God’s righteousness all the clearer? Will God be wrong in inflicting punishment? (I can but speak as a person.) Heaven forbid!
<verse eID="Rom.3.5" />
<verse sID="Rom.3.6" osisID="Rom.3.6" n="6" />Otherwise how can God judge the world?
<verse eID="Rom.3.6" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rom.3.7" osisID="Rom.3.7" n="7" />But, if my falsehood redounds to the glory of God, by making his truthfulness more apparent, why am I like others, still condemned as a sinner?
<verse eID="Rom.3.7" />
<verse sID="Rom.3.8" osisID="Rom.3.8" n="8" />Why should we not say – as some people slanderously assert that we do say – ‘Let us do evil that good may come’? The condemnation of such people is indeed just!
<verse eID="Rom.3.8" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rom.3.9" osisID="Rom.3.9" n="9" />What follows, then? Are we Jews in any way superior to others? Not at all. Our indictment against both Jews and Greeks was that all alike were in subjection to sin.
<verse eID="Rom.3.9" />
<verse sID="Rom.3.10" osisID="Rom.3.10" n="10" />As scripture says –

<verse eID="Rom.3.18" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rom.3.19" osisID="Rom.3.19" n="19" />Now we know that everything said in the Law is addressed to those who are under its authority, in order that every mouth may be closed, and to bring the whole world under God’s judgment.
<verse eID="Rom.3.19" />
<verse sID="Rom.3.20" osisID="Rom.3.20" n="20" />For no human being will be pronounced righteous before God as the result of obedience to Law; for it is Law that shows what sin is.
<verse eID="Rom.3.20" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rom.3.21" osisID="Rom.3.21" n="21" />But now, quite apart from Law, the divine righteousness stands revealed, and to it the Law and the prophets bear witness –
<verse eID="Rom.3.21" />
<verse sID="Rom.3.22" osisID="Rom.3.22" n="22" />the divine righteousness which is bestowed, through faith in Jesus Christ, on all, without distinction, who believe in him.
<verse eID="Rom.3.22" />
<verse sID="Rom.3.23" osisID="Rom.3.23" n="23" />For all have sinned, and all fall short of God’s glorious ideal,
<verse eID="Rom.3.23" />
<verse sID="Rom.3.24" osisID="Rom.3.24" n="24" />but, in his loving kindness, are being freely pronounced righteous through the deliverance found in Christ Jesus.
<verse eID="Rom.3.24" />
<verse sID="Rom.3.25" osisID="Rom.3.25" n="25" />For God set him before the world, to be, by the shedding of his blood, a means of reconciliation through faith. And this God did to prove his righteousness, and because, in his forbearance, he had passed over the sins that people had previously committed;
<verse eID="Rom.3.25" />
<verse sID="Rom.3.26" osisID="Rom.3.26" n="26" />as a proof, I repeat, at the present time, of his own righteousness, that he might be righteous in our eyes, and might pronounce righteous the person who takes their stand on faith in Jesus.
<verse eID="Rom.3.26" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rom.3.27" osisID="Rom.3.27" n="27" />What, then, becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. By what sort of Law? A Law requiring obedience? No, a Law requiring faith.
<verse eID="Rom.3.27" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rom.3.28" osisID="Rom.3.28" n="28" />For we conclude that a person is pronounced righteous on the ground of faith, quite apart from obedience to Law.
<verse eID="Rom.3.28" />
<verse sID="Rom.3.29" osisID="Rom.3.29" n="29" />Or can it be that God is the God only of the Jews? Isn’t he also the God of the Gentiles?
<verse eID="Rom.3.29" />
<verse sID="Rom.3.30" osisID="Rom.3.30" n="30" />Yes, of the Gentiles also, since there is only one God, and he will pronounce those who are circumcised righteous as the result of faith, and also those who are uncircumcised on their showing the same faith.
<verse eID="Rom.3.30" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rom.3.31" osisID="Rom.3.31" n="31" />Do we, then, use this faith to abolish Law? Heaven forbid! No, we establish Law.
<verse eID="Rom.3.31" />
<chapter eID="Rom.3" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Rom.4" osisID="Rom.4" n="4" />
<verse sID="Rom.4.1" osisID="Rom.4.1" n="1" />What then, it may be asked, are we to say about Abraham, the ancestor of our nation?
<verse eID="Rom.4.1" />
<verse sID="Rom.4.2" osisID="Rom.4.2" n="2" />If he was pronounced righteous as the result of obedience, then he has something to boast of. Yes, but not before God.
<verse eID="Rom.4.2" />
<verse sID="Rom.4.3" osisID="Rom.4.3" n="3" />For what are the words of scripture? ‘Abraham had faith in God, and his faith was regarded by God as righteousness.’
<verse eID="Rom.4.3" />
<verse sID="Rom.4.4" osisID="Rom.4.4" n="4" />Now wages are regarded as due to the person who works, not as a favor, but as a debt;
<verse eID="Rom.4.4" />
<verse sID="Rom.4.5" osisID="Rom.4.5" n="5" />while, as for the person who does not rely on their obedience, but has faith in him who can pronounce the godless righteous, their faith is regarded by God as righteousness.
<verse eID="Rom.4.5" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rom.4.6" osisID="Rom.4.6" n="6" />In precisely the same way David speaks of the blessing pronounced on the person who is regarded by God as righteous apart from actions –
<verse eID="Rom.4.6" />
<verse sID="Rom.4.7" osisID="Rom.4.7" n="7" />‘Blessed are those whose wrong-doings have been forgiven and over whose sins a veil has been drawn!
<verse eID="Rom.4.7" />
<verse sID="Rom.4.8" osisID="Rom.4.8" n="8" />Blessed the man whom the Lord will never regard as sinful!’
<verse eID="Rom.4.8" />
<verse sID="Rom.4.9" osisID="Rom.4.9" n="9" />Is this blessing, then, pronounced on the circumcised only or on the uncircumcised as well? We say that – ‘Abraham’s faith was regarded by God as righteousness.’
<verse eID="Rom.4.9" />
<verse sID="Rom.4.10" osisID="Rom.4.10" n="10" />Under what circumstances, then, did this take place? After his circumcision or before it?
<verse eID="Rom.4.10" />
<verse sID="Rom.4.11" osisID="Rom.4.11" n="11" />Not after, but before. And it was as a sign of this that he received the rite of circumcision – to show the righteousness due to the faith of an uncircumcised man – in order that he might be the father of all who have faith in God even when uncircumcised, so that they also may be regarded by God as righteous;
<verse eID="Rom.4.11" />
<verse sID="Rom.4.12" osisID="Rom.4.12" n="12" />as well as father of the circumcised – to those who are not only circumcised, but who also follow our father Abraham in that faith which he had while still uncircumcised.
<verse eID="Rom.4.12" />
<verse sID="Rom.4.13" osisID="Rom.4.13" n="13" />For the promise that he should inherit the world did not come to Abraham or his descendants through Law, but through the righteousness due to faith.
<verse eID="Rom.4.13" />
<verse sID="Rom.4.14" osisID="Rom.4.14" n="14" />If those who take their stand on Law are to inherit the world, then faith is robbed of its meaning and the promise comes to nothing!
<verse eID="Rom.4.14" />
<verse sID="Rom.4.15" osisID="Rom.4.15" n="15" />Law entails punishment; but, where no Law exists, no breach of it is possible.
<verse eID="Rom.4.15" />
<verse sID="Rom.4.16" osisID="Rom.4.16" n="16" />That is why everything is made to depend on faith: so that everything may be God’s gift, and in order that the fulfillment of the promise may be made certain for all Abraham’s descendants – not only for those who take their stand on the Law, but also for those who take their stand on the faith of Abraham. (He is the Father of us all;
<verse eID="Rom.4.16" />
<verse sID="Rom.4.17" osisID="Rom.4.17" n="17" />as scripture says – ‘I have made you the Father of many nations.’) And this they do in the sight of that God in whom Abraham had faith, and who gives life to the dead, and speaks of what does not yet exist as if it did.
<verse eID="Rom.4.17" />
<verse sID="Rom.4.18" osisID="Rom.4.18" n="18" />With no ground for hope, Abraham, sustained by hope, put faith in God; in order that, in fulfillment of the words – ‘So many will your descendants be,’ he might become ‘the Father of many nations.’
<verse eID="Rom.4.18" />
<verse sID="Rom.4.19" osisID="Rom.4.19" n="19" />Though he was nearly a hundred years old, yet his faith did not fail him, even when he thought of his own body, then utterly worn out, and remembered that Sarah was past bearing children.
<verse eID="Rom.4.19" />
<verse sID="Rom.4.20" osisID="Rom.4.20" n="20" />He was not led by want of faith to doubt God’s promise.
<verse eID="Rom.4.20" />
<verse sID="Rom.4.21" osisID="Rom.4.21" n="21" />On the contrary, his faith gave him strength; and he praised God, in the firm conviction that what God has promised he is also able to carry out.
<verse eID="Rom.4.21" />
<verse sID="Rom.4.22" osisID="Rom.4.22" n="22" />And therefore his faith ‘was regarded as righteousness.’
<verse eID="Rom.4.22" />
<verse sID="Rom.4.23" osisID="Rom.4.23" n="23" />Now these words – ‘it was regarded as righteousness’ – were not written with reference to Abraham only;
<verse eID="Rom.4.23" />
<verse sID="Rom.4.24" osisID="Rom.4.24" n="24" />but also with reference to us. Our faith, too, will be regarded by God in the same light, if we have faith in him who raised Jesus, our Lord, from the dead;
<verse eID="Rom.4.24" />
<verse sID="Rom.4.25" osisID="Rom.4.25" n="25" />for Jesus was given up to death to atone for our offenses, and was raised to life that we might be pronounced righteous.
<verse eID="Rom.4.25" />
<chapter eID="Rom.4" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Rom.5" osisID="Rom.5" n="5" />
<verse sID="Rom.5.1" osisID="Rom.5.1" n="1" />Therefore, having been pronounced righteous as the result of faith, let us enjoy peace with God through Jesus Christ, our Lord.
<verse eID="Rom.5.1" />
<verse sID="Rom.5.2" osisID="Rom.5.2" n="2" />It is through him that, by reason of our faith, we have obtained admission to that place in God’s favor in which we now stand. So let us exult in our hope of attaining God’s glorious ideal.
<verse eID="Rom.5.2" />
<verse sID="Rom.5.3" osisID="Rom.5.3" n="3" />And not only that, but let us also exult in our troubles;
<verse eID="Rom.5.3" />
<verse sID="Rom.5.4" osisID="Rom.5.4" n="4" />for we know that trouble develops endurance, and endurance strength of character, and strength of character hope,
<verse eID="Rom.5.4" />
<verse sID="Rom.5.5" osisID="Rom.5.5" n="5" />and that hope never disappoints. For the love of God has filled our hearts through the Holy Spirit which was given us;
<verse eID="Rom.5.5" />
<verse sID="Rom.5.6" osisID="Rom.5.6" n="6" />seeing that, while we were still powerless, Christ, in God’s good time, died on behalf of the godless.
<verse eID="Rom.5.6" />
<verse sID="Rom.5.7" osisID="Rom.5.7" n="7" />Even for an upright person scarcely anyone will die. For a really good person perhaps someone might even dare to die.
<verse eID="Rom.5.7" />
<verse sID="Rom.5.8" osisID="Rom.5.8" n="8" />But God puts his love for us beyond all doubt by the fact that Christ died on our behalf while we were still sinners.
<verse eID="Rom.5.8" />
<verse sID="Rom.5.9" osisID="Rom.5.9" n="9" />Much more, then, now that we have been pronounced righteous by virtue of the shedding of his blood, will we be saved through him from the wrath of God.
<verse eID="Rom.5.9" />
<verse sID="Rom.5.10" osisID="Rom.5.10" n="10" />For if, when we were God’s enemies, we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son, much more, now that we have become reconciled, will we be saved by virtue of Christ’s life.
<verse eID="Rom.5.10" />
<verse sID="Rom.5.11" osisID="Rom.5.11" n="11" />And not only that, but we exult in God, through Jesus Christ, our Lord, through whom we have now obtained this reconciliation.
<verse eID="Rom.5.11" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rom.5.12" osisID="Rom.5.12" n="12" />Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and through sin came death; so, also, death spread to all humanity, because every person has sinned.
<verse eID="Rom.5.12" />
<verse sID="Rom.5.13" osisID="Rom.5.13" n="13" />Even before the time of the Law there was sin in the world; but sin cannot be charged against someone where no Law exists.
<verse eID="Rom.5.13" />
<verse sID="Rom.5.14" osisID="Rom.5.14" n="14" />Yet, from Adam to Moses, death reigned even over those whose sin was not a breach of a law, as Adam’s was. And Adam foreshadows the One to come.
<verse eID="Rom.5.14" />
<verse sID="Rom.5.15" osisID="Rom.5.15" n="15" />But there is a contrast between Adam’s offense and God’s gracious gift. For, if by reason of the offense of the one man the whole human race died, far more were the loving kindness of God, and the gift given in the loving kindness of the one man, Jesus Christ, lavished on the whole human race.
<verse eID="Rom.5.15" />
<verse sID="Rom.5.16" osisID="Rom.5.16" n="16" />There is a contrast, too, between the gift and the results of the one man’s sin. The judgment, which followed on the one man’s sin, resulted in condemnation, but God’s gracious gift, which followed on many offenses, resulted in a decree of righteousness.
<verse eID="Rom.5.16" />
<verse sID="Rom.5.17" osisID="Rom.5.17" n="17" />For if, by reason of the offense of the one man, death reigned through that one man, far more will those, on whom God’s loving kindness and his gift of righteousness are lavished, find life, and reign through the one man, Jesus Christ.
<verse eID="Rom.5.17" />
<verse sID="Rom.5.18" osisID="Rom.5.18" n="18" />Briefly then, just as a single offense resulted for all humanity in condemnation, so, too, a single decree of righteousness resulted for all humanity in that declaration of righteousness which brings life.
<verse eID="Rom.5.18" />
<verse sID="Rom.5.19" osisID="Rom.5.19" n="19" />For, as through the disobedience of the one man the whole human race was rendered sinful, so, too, through the obedience of the one, the whole human race will be rendered righteous.
<verse eID="Rom.5.19" />
<verse sID="Rom.5.20" osisID="Rom.5.20" n="20" />Law was introduced in order that offenses might be multiplied. But, where sins were multiplied, the loving kindness of God was lavished the more,
<verse eID="Rom.5.20" />
<verse sID="Rom.5.21" osisID="Rom.5.21" n="21" />in order than, just as sin had reigned in the realm of death, so, too, might Loving-kindness reign through righteousness, and result in eternal life, through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

<!-- s --><title>Difficulties arising from this Teaching</title>
<p>
<verse sID="Rom.6.1" osisID="Rom.6.1" n="1" />What are we to say, then? Are we to continue to sin, in order that God’s loving kindness may be multiplied?
<verse eID="Rom.6.1" />
<verse sID="Rom.6.2" osisID="Rom.6.2" n="2" />Heaven forbid! We became dead to sin, and how can we go on living in it?
<verse eID="Rom.6.2" />
<verse sID="Rom.6.3" osisID="Rom.6.3" n="3" />Or can it be that you do not know that all of us, who were baptized into union with Christ Jesus, in our baptism shared his death?
<verse eID="Rom.6.3" />
<verse sID="Rom.6.4" osisID="Rom.6.4" n="4" />Consequently, through sharing his death in our baptism, we were buried with him; so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by a manifestation of the Father’s power, so we also may live a new life.
<verse eID="Rom.6.4" />
<verse sID="Rom.6.5" osisID="Rom.6.5" n="5" />If we have become united with him by the act symbolic of his death, surely we will also become united with him by the act symbolic of his resurrection.
<verse eID="Rom.6.5" />
<verse sID="Rom.6.6" osisID="Rom.6.6" n="6" />We recognize the truth that our old self was crucified with Christ, in order that the body, the stronghold of sin, might be rendered powerless, so that we should no longer be slaves to sin.
<verse eID="Rom.6.6" />
<verse sID="Rom.6.7" osisID="Rom.6.7" n="7" />For the man who has so died has been pronounced righteous and released from sin.
<verse eID="Rom.6.7" />
<verse sID="Rom.6.8" osisID="Rom.6.8" n="8" />And our belief is, that, as we have shared Christ’s death, we will also share his life.
<verse eID="Rom.6.8" />
<verse sID="Rom.6.9" osisID="Rom.6.9" n="9" />We know, indeed, that Christ, having once risen from the dead, will not die again. Death has power over him no longer.
<verse eID="Rom.6.9" />
<verse sID="Rom.6.10" osisID="Rom.6.10" n="10" />For the death that he died was a death to sin, once and for all. But the life that he now lives, he lives for God.
<verse eID="Rom.6.10" />
<verse sID="Rom.6.11" osisID="Rom.6.11" n="11" />So let it be with you – regard yourselves as dead to sin, but as living for God, through union with Christ Jesus.
<verse eID="Rom.6.11" />
<verse sID="Rom.6.12" osisID="Rom.6.12" n="12" />Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal bodies and compel you to obey its cravings.
<verse eID="Rom.6.12" />
<verse sID="Rom.6.13" osisID="Rom.6.13" n="13" />Do not offer any part of your bodies to sin, in the cause of unrighteousness, but once for all offer yourselves to God (as those who, though once dead, now have life), and devote every part of your bodies to the cause of righteousness.
<verse eID="Rom.6.13" />
<verse sID="Rom.6.14" osisID="Rom.6.14" n="14" />For sin will not lord it over you. You are living under the reign, not of Law, but of love.
<verse eID="Rom.6.14" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rom.6.15" osisID="Rom.6.15" n="15" />What follows, then? Are we to sin because we are living under the reign of love and not of Law? Heaven forbid!
<verse eID="Rom.6.15" />
<verse sID="Rom.6.16" osisID="Rom.6.16" n="16" />Surely you know that, when you offer yourselves as servants, to obey anyone, you are the servants of the person whom you obey, whether the service be a service sin which leads to death, or a service Duty which leads to righteousness.
<verse eID="Rom.6.16" />
<verse sID="Rom.6.17" osisID="Rom.6.17" n="17" />God be thanked that, though you were once servants of sin, yet you learned to give hearty obedience to that form of doctrine under which you were placed.
<verse eID="Rom.6.17" />
<verse sID="Rom.6.18" osisID="Rom.6.18" n="18" />Set free from the control of sin, you became servants to righteousness.
<verse eID="Rom.6.18" />
<verse sID="Rom.6.19" osisID="Rom.6.19" n="19" />I can but speak as people do because of the weakness of your earthly nature. Once you offered every part of your bodies to the service of impurity, and of wickedness, which leads to further wickedness. Now, in the same way, offer them to the service of righteousness, which leads to holiness.
<verse eID="Rom.6.19" />
<verse sID="Rom.6.20" osisID="Rom.6.20" n="20" />While you were still servants of sin, you were free as regards righteousness.
<verse eID="Rom.6.20" />
<verse sID="Rom.6.21" osisID="Rom.6.21" n="21" />But what were the fruits that you reaped from those things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of such things is death.
<verse eID="Rom.6.21" />
<verse sID="Rom.6.22" osisID="Rom.6.22" n="22" />But now that you have been set free from the control of sin, and have become servants to God, the fruit that you reap is an ever increasing holiness, and the end eternal life.
<verse eID="Rom.6.22" />
<verse sID="Rom.6.23" osisID="Rom.6.23" n="23" />The wages of sin are death, but the gift of God is eternal life, through union with Christ Jesus, our Lord.
<verse eID="Rom.6.23" />
<chapter eID="Rom.6" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Rom.7" osisID="Rom.7" n="7" />
<verse sID="Rom.7.1" osisID="Rom.7.1" n="1" />Surely, friends, you know (for I am speaking to people who know what Law means) that Law has power over a person only as long as they lives.
<verse eID="Rom.7.1" />
<verse sID="Rom.7.2" osisID="Rom.7.2" n="2" />For example, by law a married woman is bound to her husband while he is living; but, if her husband dies, she is set free from the law that bound her to him.
<verse eID="Rom.7.2" />
<verse sID="Rom.7.3" osisID="Rom.7.3" n="3" />If, then, during her husband’s lifetime, she unites herself to another man, she will be called an adulteress; but, if her husband dies, the law has no further hold on her, nor, if she unites herself to another man, is she an adulteress.
<verse eID="Rom.7.3" />
<verse sID="Rom.7.4" osisID="Rom.7.4" n="4" />And so with you, my friends; as far as the Law was concerned, you underwent death in the crucified body of the Christ, so that you might be united to another, to him who was raised from the dead, in order that our lives might bear fruit for God.
<verse eID="Rom.7.4" />
<verse sID="Rom.7.5" osisID="Rom.7.5" n="5" />When we were living merely earthly lives, our sinful passions, aroused by the Law, were active in every part of our bodies, with the result that our lives bore fruit for death.
<verse eID="Rom.7.5" />
<verse sID="Rom.7.6" osisID="Rom.7.6" n="6" />But now we are set free from the Law, because we are dead to that which once kept us under restraint; and so we serve under new, spiritual conditions, and not under old, written regulations.
<verse eID="Rom.7.6" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rom.7.7" osisID="Rom.7.7" n="7" />What are we to say, then? That Law and sin are the same thing? Heaven forbid! On the contrary, I should not have learned what sin is, had not it been for Law. If the Law did not say ‘You must not covet,’ I should not know what it is to covet.
<verse eID="Rom.7.7" />
<verse sID="Rom.7.8" osisID="Rom.7.8" n="8" />But sin took advantage of the Commandment to arouse in me every form of covetousness, for where there is no consciousness of Law sin shows no sign of life.
<verse eID="Rom.7.8" />
<verse sID="Rom.7.9" osisID="Rom.7.9" n="9" />There was a time when I myself, unconscious of Law, was alive; but when the Commandment was brought home to me, sin sprang into life, while I died!
<verse eID="Rom.7.9" />
<verse sID="Rom.7.10" osisID="Rom.7.10" n="10" />The Commandment that should have meant life I found to result in death!
<verse eID="Rom.7.10" />
<verse sID="Rom.7.11" osisID="Rom.7.11" n="11" />sin took advantage of the Commandment to deceive me, and used it to bring about my death.
<verse eID="Rom.7.11" />
<verse sID="Rom.7.12" osisID="Rom.7.12" n="12" />And so the Law is holy, and each Commandment is also holy, and just, and good.
<verse eID="Rom.7.12" />
<verse sID="Rom.7.13" osisID="Rom.7.13" n="13" />Did, then, a thing, which in itself was good, involve death in my case? Heaven forbid! It was sin that involved death; so that, by its use of what I regarded as good to bring about my death, its true nature might appear; and in this way the Commandment showed how intensely sinful sin is.
<verse eID="Rom.7.13" />
<verse sID="Rom.7.14" osisID="Rom.7.14" n="14" />We know that the Law is spiritual, but I am earthly – sold into slavery to sin.
<verse eID="Rom.7.14" />
<verse sID="Rom.7.15" osisID="Rom.7.15" n="15" />I do not understand my own actions. For I am so far from habitually doing what I want to do, that I find myself doing the thing that I hate.
<verse eID="Rom.7.15" />
<verse sID="Rom.7.16" osisID="Rom.7.16" n="16" />But when I do what I want not to do, I am admitting that the Law is right.
<verse eID="Rom.7.16" />
<verse sID="Rom.7.17" osisID="Rom.7.17" n="17" />This being so, the action is no longer my own, but is done by the sin which is within me.
<verse eID="Rom.7.17" />
<verse sID="Rom.7.18" osisID="Rom.7.18" n="18" />I know that there is nothing good in me – I mean in my earthly nature. For, although it is easy for me to want to do right, to act rightly is not easy.
<verse eID="Rom.7.18" />
<verse sID="Rom.7.19" osisID="Rom.7.19" n="19" />I fail to do the good thing that I want to do, but the bad thing that I want not to do – that I habitually do.
<verse eID="Rom.7.19" />
<verse sID="Rom.7.20" osisID="Rom.7.20" n="20" />But, when I do the thing that I want not to do, the action is no longer my own, but is done by the sin which is within me.
<verse eID="Rom.7.20" />
<verse sID="Rom.7.21" osisID="Rom.7.21" n="21" />This, then, is the law that I find – when I want to do right, wrong presents itself!
<verse eID="Rom.7.21" />
<verse sID="Rom.7.22" osisID="Rom.7.22" n="22" />At heart I delight in the Law of God;
<verse eID="Rom.7.22" />
<verse sID="Rom.7.23" osisID="Rom.7.23" n="23" />but throughout my body I see a different law, one which is in conflict with the law accepted by my reason, and which endeavors to make me a prisoner to that law of sin which exists throughout my body.
<verse eID="Rom.7.23" />
<verse sID="Rom.7.24" osisID="Rom.7.24" n="24" />Miserable man that I am! Who will deliver me from the body that is bringing me to this death?
<verse eID="Rom.7.24" />
<verse sID="Rom.7.25" osisID="Rom.7.25" n="25" />Thank God, there is deliverance through Jesus Christ, our Lord! Well then, for myself, with my reason I serve the Law of God, but with my earthly nature the Law of sin.
<verse eID="Rom.7.25" />
<chapter eID="Rom.7" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Rom.8" osisID="Rom.8" n="8" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.1" osisID="Rom.8.1" n="1" />There is, therefore, now no condemnation for those who are in union with Christ Jesus;
<verse eID="Rom.8.1" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.2" osisID="Rom.8.2" n="2" />for through your union with Christ Jesus, the Law of the life-giving Spirit has set you free from the Law of sin and death.
<verse eID="Rom.8.2" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.3" osisID="Rom.8.3" n="3" />What Law could not do, in so far as our earthly nature weakened its action, God did, by sending his own Son, with a nature resembling our sinful nature, to atone for sin. He condemned sin in that earthly nature,
<verse eID="Rom.8.3" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.4" osisID="Rom.8.4" n="4" />so that the requirements of the Law might be satisfied in us who live now in obedience, not to our earthly nature, but to the Spirit.
<verse eID="Rom.8.4" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.5" osisID="Rom.8.5" n="5" />They who follow their earthly nature are earthly-minded, while they who follow the Spirit are spiritually minded.
<verse eID="Rom.8.5" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.6" osisID="Rom.8.6" n="6" />To be earthly-minded means death, to be spiritually minded means life and peace;
<verse eID="Rom.8.6" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.7" osisID="Rom.8.7" n="7" />because to be earthly-minded is to be an enemy to God, for such a mind does not submit to the Law of God, nor indeed can it do so.
<verse eID="Rom.8.7" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.8" osisID="Rom.8.8" n="8" />They who are earthly cannot please God.
<verse eID="Rom.8.8" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.9" osisID="Rom.8.9" n="9" />You, however, are not earthly but spiritual, since the Spirit of God lives within you. Unless a person has the Spirit of Christ, they do not belong to Christ;
<verse eID="Rom.8.9" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.10" osisID="Rom.8.10" n="10" />but, if Christ is within you, then, though the body is dead as a consequence of sin, the spirit is life as a consequence of righteousness.
<verse eID="Rom.8.10" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.11" osisID="Rom.8.11" n="11" />And, if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead lives within you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will give life even to your mortal bodies, through his Spirit living within you.
<verse eID="Rom.8.11" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rom.8.12" osisID="Rom.8.12" n="12" />So then, friends, we owe nothing to our earthly nature, that we should live in obedience to it.
<verse eID="Rom.8.12" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.13" osisID="Rom.8.13" n="13" />If you live in obedience to your earthly nature, you will inevitably die; but if, by the power of the Spirit, you put an end to the evil habits of the body, you will live.
<verse eID="Rom.8.13" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.14" osisID="Rom.8.14" n="14" />All who are guided by the Spirit of God are sons of God.
<verse eID="Rom.8.14" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.15" osisID="Rom.8.15" n="15" />For you did not receive the spirit of a slave, to fill you once more with fear, but the spirit of a son which leads us to cry ‘Abba, Our Father.’
<verse eID="Rom.8.15" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.16" osisID="Rom.8.16" n="16" />The Spirit himself unites with our spirits in bearing witness to our being God’s children,
<verse eID="Rom.8.16" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.17" osisID="Rom.8.17" n="17" />and if children, then heirs – heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ, since we share Christ’s sufferings in order that we may also share his glory.
<verse eID="Rom.8.17" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rom.8.18" osisID="Rom.8.18" n="18" />I do not count the sufferings of our present life worthy of mention when compared with the glory that is to be revealed and bestowed on us.
<verse eID="Rom.8.18" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.19" osisID="Rom.8.19" n="19" />All Nature awaits with eager expectation the appearing of the sons of God.
<verse eID="Rom.8.19" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.20" osisID="Rom.8.20" n="20" />For Nature was made subject to imperfection – not by its own choice, but owing to him who made it so –
<verse eID="Rom.8.20" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.21" osisID="Rom.8.21" n="21" />yet not without the hope that some day Nature, also, will be set free from enslavement to decay, and will attain to the freedom which will mark the glory of the children of God.
<verse eID="Rom.8.21" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.22" osisID="Rom.8.22" n="22" />We know, indeed, that all Nature alike has been groaning in the pains of labor to this very hour.
<verse eID="Rom.8.22" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.23" osisID="Rom.8.23" n="23" />And not Nature only; but we ourselves also, though we have already a first gift of the Spirit – we ourselves are inwardly groaning, while we eagerly await our full adoption as sons – the redemption of our bodies.
<verse eID="Rom.8.23" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.24" osisID="Rom.8.24" n="24" />By our hope we were saved. But the thing hoped for is no longer an object of hope when it is before our eyes; for who hopes for what is before his eyes?
<verse eID="Rom.8.24" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.25" osisID="Rom.8.25" n="25" />But when we hope for what is not before our eyes, then we wait for it with patience.
<verse eID="Rom.8.25" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rom.8.26" osisID="Rom.8.26" n="26" />So, also, the Spirit supports us in our weakness. We do not even know how to pray as we should; but the Spirit himself pleads for us in sighs that can find no utterance.
<verse eID="Rom.8.26" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.27" osisID="Rom.8.27" n="27" />Yet he who searches all our hearts knows what the Spirit’s meaning is, because the pleadings of the Spirit for Christ’s people are in accordance with his will.
<verse eID="Rom.8.27" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.28" osisID="Rom.8.28" n="28" />But we do know that God causes all things to work together for the good of those who love him – those who have received the call in accordance with his purpose.
<verse eID="Rom.8.28" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.29" osisID="Rom.8.29" n="29" />For those whom God chose from the first he also destined from the first to be transformed into likeness to his Son, so that his Son might be the eldest among many brothers and sisters.
<verse eID="Rom.8.29" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.30" osisID="Rom.8.30" n="30" />And those whom God destined for this he also called; and those whom he called he also pronounced righteous; and those whom he pronounced righteous he also brought to glory.
<verse eID="Rom.8.30" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rom.8.31" osisID="Rom.8.31" n="31" />What are we to say, then, in the light of all this?
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">If God is on our side, who can there be against us? <verse eID="Rom.8.31" /></l>
<l level="1">
<verse sID="Rom.8.32" osisID="Rom.8.32" n="32" />God did not withhold his own Son, but gave him up on behalf of us all; will he not, then, with him, freely give us all things? <verse eID="Rom.8.32" /></l>
<l level="1">
<verse sID="Rom.8.33" osisID="Rom.8.33" n="33" />Who will bring a charge against any of God’s people? He who pronounces them righteous is God! <verse eID="Rom.8.33" /></l>
<l level="1">
<verse sID="Rom.8.34" osisID="Rom.8.34" n="34" />Who is there to condemn them? He who died for us is Christ Jesus! – or, rather, it was he who was raised from the dead, and who is now at God’s right hand and is even pleading on our behalf! <verse eID="Rom.8.34" /></l>
<l level="1">
<verse sID="Rom.8.35" osisID="Rom.8.35" n="35" />Who is there to separate us from the love of the Christ? Will trouble, or difficulty, or persecution, or hunger, or nakedness, or danger, or the sword? <verse eID="Rom.8.35" /></l>
</lg>
<p>
<verse sID="Rom.8.36" osisID="Rom.8.36" n="36" />Scripture says – ‘For your sake we are being killed all the day long, We are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.’
<verse eID="Rom.8.36" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.37" osisID="Rom.8.37" n="37" />Yet amid all these things we more than conquer through him who loved us!
<verse eID="Rom.8.37" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.38" osisID="Rom.8.38" n="38" />For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor archangels, nor the present, nor the future, nor any powers,
<verse eID="Rom.8.38" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.39" osisID="Rom.8.39" n="39" />nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God revealed in Christ Jesus, our Lord!
<verse eID="Rom.8.39" />
<chapter eID="Rom.8" />
<chapter sID="Rom.9" osisID="Rom.9" n="9" />
</p>
<!-- s --><title>Gentiles and Jews</title>
<p>
<verse sID="Rom.9.1" osisID="Rom.9.1" n="1" />I am speaking the truth as one in union with Christ; it is no lie; and my conscience, enlightened by the Holy Spirit,
<verse eID="Rom.9.1" />
<verse sID="Rom.9.2" osisID="Rom.9.2" n="2" />bears me out when I say that there is a great weight of sorrow on me and that my heart is never free from pain.
<verse eID="Rom.9.2" />
<verse sID="Rom.9.3" osisID="Rom.9.3" n="3" />I could wish that I were myself accursed and severed from the Christ, for the sake of my people – my own flesh and blood.
<verse eID="Rom.9.3" />
<verse sID="Rom.9.4" osisID="Rom.9.4" n="4" />For they are Israelites, and theirs are the adoption as sons, the visible presence, the Covenants, the revealed Law, the Temple worship, and the Promises.
<verse eID="Rom.9.4" />
<verse sID="Rom.9.5" osisID="Rom.9.5" n="5" />They are descended from the Patriarchs; and, as far as his human nature was concerned, from them came the Christ – he who is supreme over all things, God for ever blessed. Amen.
<verse eID="Rom.9.5" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rom.9.6" osisID="Rom.9.6" n="6" />Not that God’s Word has failed. For it is not all who are descended from Israel who are true Israelites;
<verse eID="Rom.9.6" />
<verse sID="Rom.9.7" osisID="Rom.9.7" n="7" />nor, because they are Abraham’s descendants, are they all his children; but – ‘It is Isaac’s children who will be called your descendants.’
<verse eID="Rom.9.7" />
<verse sID="Rom.9.8" osisID="Rom.9.8" n="8" />This means that it is not the children born in the course of nature who are God’s children, but it is the children born in fulfillment of the Promise who are to be regarded as Abraham’s descendants.
<verse eID="Rom.9.8" />
<verse sID="Rom.9.9" osisID="Rom.9.9" n="9" />For these words are the words of a promise – ‘About this time I will come, and Sarah will have a son.’
<verse eID="Rom.9.9" />
<verse sID="Rom.9.10" osisID="Rom.9.10" n="10" />Nor is that all. There is also the case of Rebecca, when she was about to bear children to our ancestor Isaac.
<verse eID="Rom.9.10" />
<verse sID="Rom.9.11" osisID="Rom.9.11" n="11" />For in order that the purpose of God, working through selection, might not fail – a selection depending, not on obedience, but on his call – Rebecca was told, before her children were born and before they had done anything either right or wrong,
<verse eID="Rom.9.11" />
<verse sID="Rom.9.12" osisID="Rom.9.12" n="12" />that the elder would be a servant to the younger.
<verse eID="Rom.9.12" />
<verse sID="Rom.9.13" osisID="Rom.9.13" n="13" />The words of scripture are – ‘I loved Jacob, but I hated Esau.’
<verse eID="Rom.9.13" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rom.9.14" osisID="Rom.9.14" n="14" />What are we to say, then? Is God guilty of injustice? Heaven forbid!
<verse eID="Rom.9.14" />
<verse sID="Rom.9.15" osisID="Rom.9.15" n="15" />For his words to Moses are – ‘I will take pity on whom I take pity, and be merciful to whom I am merciful.’
<verse eID="Rom.9.15" />
<verse sID="Rom.9.16" osisID="Rom.9.16" n="16" />So, then, all depends, not on human wishes or human efforts, but on God’s mercy.
<verse eID="Rom.9.16" />
<verse sID="Rom.9.17" osisID="Rom.9.17" n="17" />In scripture, again, it is said to Pharaoh – ‘It was for this purpose that I raised you to the throne, to show my power by my dealings with you, and to make my name known throughout the world.’
<verse eID="Rom.9.17" />
<verse sID="Rom.9.18" osisID="Rom.9.18" n="18" />So, then, where God wills, he takes pity, and where he wills, he hardens the heart.
<verse eID="Rom.9.18" />
<verse sID="Rom.9.19" osisID="Rom.9.19" n="19" />Perhaps you will say to me – ‘How can anyone still be blamed? For who withstands his purpose?’
<verse eID="Rom.9.19" />
<verse sID="Rom.9.20" osisID="Rom.9.20" n="20" />I might rather ask ‘Who are you who are arguing with God?’ Does a thing which a person has moulded say to the person who has moulded it ‘Why did you make me like this?’
<verse eID="Rom.9.20" />
<verse sID="Rom.9.21" osisID="Rom.9.21" n="21" />Has not the potter absolute power over their clay, so that out of the same lump they make one thing for better, and another for common, use?
<verse eID="Rom.9.21" />
<verse sID="Rom.9.22" osisID="Rom.9.22" n="22" />And what if God, intending to reveal his displeasure and make his power known, bore most patiently with the objects of his displeasure, though they were fit only to be destroyed,
<verse eID="Rom.9.22" />
<verse sID="Rom.9.23" osisID="Rom.9.23" n="23" />so as to make known his surpassing glory in dealing with the objects of his mercy, whom he prepared beforehand for glory,
<verse eID="Rom.9.23" />
<verse sID="Rom.9.24" osisID="Rom.9.24" n="24" />and whom he called – even us – Not only from among the Jews but from among the Gentiles also!
<verse eID="Rom.9.24" />
<verse sID="Rom.9.25" osisID="Rom.9.25" n="25" />This, indeed, is what he says in the book of Hosea – ‘Those who were not my people, I will call my people, and those who were unloved I will love.
<verse eID="Rom.9.25" />
<verse sID="Rom.9.26" osisID="Rom.9.26" n="26" />And in the place where it was said to them – “You are not my people”, they will be called sons of the living God.’
<verse eID="Rom.9.26" />
<verse sID="Rom.9.27" osisID="Rom.9.27" n="27" />And Isaiah cries aloud over Israel – ‘Though the sons of Israel are like the sand of the sea in number, only a remnant of them will escape!
<verse eID="Rom.9.27" />
<verse sID="Rom.9.28" osisID="Rom.9.28" n="28" />For the Lord will execute his sentence on the world, fully and without delay.’
<verse eID="Rom.9.28" />
<verse sID="Rom.9.29" osisID="Rom.9.29" n="29" />It is as Isaiah foretold – ‘Had not the Lord of Hosts spared some few of our people to us, we should have become like Sodom and been made to resemble Gomorrah.’
<verse eID="Rom.9.29" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rom.9.30" osisID="Rom.9.30" n="30" />What are we to say, then? Why, that Gentiles, who were not in search of righteousness, secured it – a righteousness which was the result of faith;
<verse eID="Rom.9.30" />
<verse sID="Rom.9.31" osisID="Rom.9.31" n="31" />while Israel, which was in search of a Law which would ensure righteousness, failed to discover one.
<verse eID="Rom.9.31" />
<verse sID="Rom.9.32" osisID="Rom.9.32" n="32" />And why? Because they looked to obedience, and not to faith, to secure it. They stumbled over the stumbling-block.
<verse eID="Rom.9.32" />
<verse sID="Rom.9.33" osisID="Rom.9.33" n="33" />As scripture says – ‘See, I place a stumbling-block in Zion – a rock which will prove a hindrance; and he who believes in him will have no cause for shame.’
<verse eID="Rom.9.33" />
<chapter eID="Rom.9" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Rom.10" osisID="Rom.10" n="10" />
<verse sID="Rom.10.1" osisID="Rom.10.1" n="1" />My friends, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for my people is for their salvation.
<verse eID="Rom.10.1" />
<verse sID="Rom.10.2" osisID="Rom.10.2" n="2" />I can testify that they are zealous for the honor of God; but they are not guided by true insight,
<verse eID="Rom.10.2" />
<verse sID="Rom.10.3" osisID="Rom.10.3" n="3" />for, in their ignorance of the divine righteousness, and in their eagerness to set up a righteousness of their own, they refused to accept with submission the divine righteousness.
<verse eID="Rom.10.3" />
<verse sID="Rom.10.4" osisID="Rom.10.4" n="4" />For Christ has brought Law to an end, so that righteousness may be obtained by everyone who believes in him.
<verse eID="Rom.10.4" />
<verse sID="Rom.10.5" osisID="Rom.10.5" n="5" />For Moses writes that, as for the righteousness which results from Law, those who practice it will find life through it.
<verse eID="Rom.10.5" />
<verse sID="Rom.10.6" osisID="Rom.10.6" n="6" />But the righteousness which results from faith finds expression in these words: ‘Do not say to yourself “Who will go up into heaven?”’ (which means to bring Christ down)
<verse eID="Rom.10.6" />
<verse sID="Rom.10.7" osisID="Rom.10.7" n="7" />‘or “Who will go down into the depths below?”’ (which means to bring Christ up from the dead).
<verse eID="Rom.10.7" />
<verse sID="Rom.10.8" osisID="Rom.10.8" n="8" />No, but what does it say? ‘The message is near you, on your lips and in your heart’ (which means ‘The Message of faith’ which we proclaim).
<verse eID="Rom.10.8" />
<verse sID="Rom.10.9" osisID="Rom.10.9" n="9" />For, if with your lips you acknowledge the truth of the message that JESUS IS LORD, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
<verse eID="Rom.10.9" />
<verse sID="Rom.10.10" osisID="Rom.10.10" n="10" />For with their hearts people believe and so attain to righteousness, while with their lips they make their Profession of faith and so find salvation.
<verse eID="Rom.10.10" />
<verse sID="Rom.10.11" osisID="Rom.10.11" n="11" />As the passage of scripture says – ‘No one who believes in him will have any cause for shame.’
<verse eID="Rom.10.11" />
<verse sID="Rom.10.12" osisID="Rom.10.12" n="12" />For no distinction is made between the Jew and the Greek, for all have the same Lord, and he is bountiful to all who invoke him.
<verse eID="Rom.10.12" />
<verse sID="Rom.10.13" osisID="Rom.10.13" n="13" />For everyone who invokes the name of the Lord will be saved.
<verse eID="Rom.10.13" />
<verse sID="Rom.10.14" osisID="Rom.10.14" n="14" />But how, it may be asked, are they to invoke one in whom they have not learned to believe? And how are they to believe in one whose words they have not heard? And how are they to hear his words unless someone proclaims him?
<verse eID="Rom.10.14" />
<verse sID="Rom.10.15" osisID="Rom.10.15" n="15" />And how is anyone to proclaim him unless they are sent as his messengers? As scripture says – ‘How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!’
<verse eID="Rom.10.15" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rom.10.16" osisID="Rom.10.16" n="16" />Still, it may be said, everyone did not give heed to the good news. No, for Isaiah asks – ‘Lord, who has believed our teaching?’
<verse eID="Rom.10.16" />
<verse sID="Rom.10.17" osisID="Rom.10.17" n="17" />And so we gather, faith is a result of teaching, and the teaching comes in the message of Christ.
<verse eID="Rom.10.17" />
<verse sID="Rom.10.18" osisID="Rom.10.18" n="18" />But I ask ‘Is it possible that people have never heard?’ No, indeed, for – ‘Their voices spread through all the earth, and their message to the ends of the world.’
<verse eID="Rom.10.18" />
<verse sID="Rom.10.19" osisID="Rom.10.19" n="19" />But again I ask ‘Did not the people of Israel understand?’ First there is Moses, who says – ‘I, the Lord, will stir you to rivalry with a nation which is no nation; Against an undiscerning nation I will arouse your anger.’
<verse eID="Rom.10.19" />
<verse sID="Rom.10.20" osisID="Rom.10.20" n="20" />And Isaiah says boldly – ‘I was found by those who were not seeking me; I made myself known to those who were not inquiring of me.’
<verse eID="Rom.10.20" />
<verse sID="Rom.10.21" osisID="Rom.10.21" n="21" />But of the people of Israel he says – ‘All day long I have stretched out my hands to a people who disobey and contradict.’
<verse eID="Rom.10.21" />
<chapter eID="Rom.10" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Rom.11" osisID="Rom.11" n="11" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.1" osisID="Rom.11.1" n="1" />I ask, then, ‘Has God rejected his people?’ Heaven forbid! For I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.
<verse eID="Rom.11.1" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.2" osisID="Rom.11.2" n="2" />God has not rejected his people, whom he chose from the first. Have you forgotten the words of scripture in the story of Elijah – how he appeals to God against Israel?
<verse eID="Rom.11.2" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.3" osisID="Rom.11.3" n="3" />‘Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have pulled down your altars, and I only am left; and now they are eager to take my life.’
<verse eID="Rom.11.3" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.4" osisID="Rom.11.4" n="4" />But what was the divine response? ‘I have kept for myself seven thousand who have never bowed the knee to Baal.’
<verse eID="Rom.11.4" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.5" osisID="Rom.11.5" n="5" />And so in our own time, too, there is to be found a remnant of our nation selected by God in love.
<verse eID="Rom.11.5" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.6" osisID="Rom.11.6" n="6" />But if in love, then it is not as a result of obedience. Otherwise love would cease to be love.
<verse eID="Rom.11.6" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.7" osisID="Rom.11.7" n="7" />What follows from this? Why, that Israel as a nation failed to secure what it was seeking, while those whom God selected did secure it.
<verse eID="Rom.11.7" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.8" osisID="Rom.11.8" n="8" />The rest grew callous; as scripture says – ‘God has given them a deadness of mind – eyes that are not to see and ears that are not to hear – and it is so to this very day.’
<verse eID="Rom.11.8" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.9" osisID="Rom.11.9" n="9" />David, too, says – ‘May their feasts prove a snare and a trap to them – a hindrance and a retribution;
<verse eID="Rom.11.9" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.10" osisID="Rom.11.10" n="10" />may their eyes be darkened, so that they cannot see; and do you always make their backs to bend.’
<verse eID="Rom.11.10" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.11" osisID="Rom.11.11" n="11" />I ask then – ‘Was their stumbling to result in their fall?’ Heaven forbid! On the contrary, through their falling away salvation has reached the Gentiles, to stir the rivalry of Israel.
<verse eID="Rom.11.11" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.12" osisID="Rom.11.12" n="12" />And, if their falling away has enriched the world, and their failure has enriched the Gentiles, how much more will result from their full restoration!
<verse eID="Rom.11.12" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rom.11.13" osisID="Rom.11.13" n="13" />But I am speaking to you who were Gentiles.
<verse eID="Rom.11.13" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.14" osisID="Rom.11.14" n="14" />Being myself an apostle to the Gentiles, I exalt my office, in the hope that I may stir my countrymen to rivalry, and so save some of them.
<verse eID="Rom.11.14" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.15" osisID="Rom.11.15" n="15" />For, if their being cast aside has meant the reconciliation of the world, what will their reception mean, but life from the dead?
<verse eID="Rom.11.15" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.16" osisID="Rom.11.16" n="16" />If the first handful of dough in holy, so is the whole mass; and if the root is holy, so are the branches.
<verse eID="Rom.11.16" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.17" osisID="Rom.11.17" n="17" />Some, however, of the branches were broken off, and you, who were only a wild olive, were grafted in among them, and came to share with them the root which is the source of the richness of the cultivated olive.
<verse eID="Rom.11.17" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.18" osisID="Rom.11.18" n="18" />Yet do not exult over the other branches. But, if you do exult over them, remember that you do not support the root, but that the root supports you.
<verse eID="Rom.11.18" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.19" osisID="Rom.11.19" n="19" />But branches, you will say, were broken off, so that I might be grafted in.
<verse eID="Rom.11.19" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.20" osisID="Rom.11.20" n="20" />True; it was because of their want of faith that they were broken off, and it is because of your faith that you are standing. Do not think too highly of yourself, but beware.
<verse eID="Rom.11.20" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.21" osisID="Rom.11.21" n="21" />For, if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you.
<verse eID="Rom.11.21" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.22" osisID="Rom.11.22" n="22" />See, then, both the goodness and the severity of God – his severity towards those who fell, and his goodness towards you, provided that you continue to confide in that goodness; otherwise you, also, will be cut off.
<verse eID="Rom.11.22" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.23" osisID="Rom.11.23" n="23" />And they, too, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in; for God has it in his power to graft them in again.
<verse eID="Rom.11.23" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.24" osisID="Rom.11.24" n="24" />If you were cut off from your natural stock – a wild olive – and were grafted, contrary to the course of nature, on a good olive, much more will they – the natural branches – be grafted back into their parent tree.
<verse eID="Rom.11.24" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rom.11.25" osisID="Rom.11.25" n="25" />My friends, so that you don’t think too highly of yourselves, I want you to recognize the truth, hitherto hidden, that the callousness which has come over Israel is only partial, and will continue only until the whole Gentile world has been gathered in.
<verse eID="Rom.11.25" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.26" osisID="Rom.11.26" n="26" />And then all Israel will be saved. As scripture says – ‘From Zion will come the Deliverer; he will banish ungodliness from Jacob.
<verse eID="Rom.11.26" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.27" osisID="Rom.11.27" n="27" />And they will see the fulfillment of my covenant, when I have taken away their sins.’
<verse eID="Rom.11.27" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.28" osisID="Rom.11.28" n="28" />From the standpoint of the good news, the Jews are God’s enemies for your sake; but from the standpoint of God’s selection, they are dear to him for the sake of the Patriarchs.
<verse eID="Rom.11.28" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.29" osisID="Rom.11.29" n="29" />For God never regrets his gifts or his call.
<verse eID="Rom.11.29" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.30" osisID="Rom.11.30" n="30" />Just as you at one time were disobedient to him, but have now found mercy in the day of their disobedience;
<verse eID="Rom.11.30" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.31" osisID="Rom.11.31" n="31" />so, too, they have now become disobedient in your day of mercy, in order that they also in their turn may now find mercy.
<verse eID="Rom.11.31" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.32" osisID="Rom.11.32" n="32" />For God has given all alike over to disobedience, that to all alike he may show mercy.
<verse eID="Rom.11.32" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.33" osisID="Rom.11.33" n="33" />Oh! The unfathomable wisdom and knowledge of God! How inscrutable are his judgments, how untraceable his ways! Yes –
<verse eID="Rom.11.33" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.34" osisID="Rom.11.34" n="34" />Who has ever comprehended the mind of the Lord? Who has ever become his counsellor?
<verse eID="Rom.11.34" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.35" osisID="Rom.11.35" n="35" />Or who has first given to him, so that he may claim a reward?
<verse eID="Rom.11.35" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.36" osisID="Rom.11.36" n="36" />For all things are from him, through him, and for him. And to him be all glory for ever and ever! Amen.

<!-- s --><title>Advice on Daily Life</title>
<p>
<verse sID="Rom.12.1" osisID="Rom.12.1" n="1" />I entreat you, then, friends, by the mercies of God, to offer your bodies as a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, for this is your rational worship.
<verse eID="Rom.12.1" />
<verse sID="Rom.12.2" osisID="Rom.12.2" n="2" />Do not conform to the fashion of this world; but be transformed by the complete change that has come over your minds, so that you may discern what God’s will is – all that is good, acceptable, and perfect.
<verse eID="Rom.12.2" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rom.12.3" osisID="Rom.12.3" n="3" />In fulfillment of the charge with which I have been entrusted, I tell every one of you not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think, but to think until he learns to think soberly – in accordance with the measure of faith that God has allotted to each.
<verse eID="Rom.12.3" />
<verse sID="Rom.12.4" osisID="Rom.12.4" n="4" />For, just as in the human body there is a union of many parts, and each part has its own function,
<verse eID="Rom.12.4" />
<verse sID="Rom.12.5" osisID="Rom.12.5" n="5" />so we, by our union in Christ, many though we are, form but one body, and individually we are related one to another as its parts.
<verse eID="Rom.12.5" />
<verse sID="Rom.12.6" osisID="Rom.12.6" n="6" />Since our gifts differ in accordance with the particular charge entrusted to us, if our gift is to preach, let our preaching correspond to our faith;
<verse eID="Rom.12.6" />
<verse sID="Rom.12.7" osisID="Rom.12.7" n="7" />if it is to minister to others, let us devote ourselves to our ministry; the teacher to their teaching,
<verse eID="Rom.12.7" />
<verse sID="Rom.12.8" osisID="Rom.12.8" n="8" />the counselor to their counsel. Let the person who gives in charity do so with a generous heart; let the person who is in authority exercise due diligence; let the person who shows kindness do so in a cheerful spirit.
<verse eID="Rom.12.8" />
<verse sID="Rom.12.9" osisID="Rom.12.9" n="9" />Let your love be sincere. Hate the wrong; cling to the right.
<verse eID="Rom.12.9" />
<verse sID="Rom.12.10" osisID="Rom.12.10" n="10" />In the love of the community of the Lord’s followers, be affectionate to one another; in showing respect, set an example of deference to one another;
<verse eID="Rom.12.10" />
<verse sID="Rom.12.11" osisID="Rom.12.11" n="11" />never flagging in zeal; fervent in spirit; serving the Master;
<verse eID="Rom.12.11" />
<verse sID="Rom.12.12" osisID="Rom.12.12" n="12" />rejoicing in your hope; steadfast under persecution; persevering in prayer;
<verse eID="Rom.12.12" />
<verse sID="Rom.12.13" osisID="Rom.12.13" n="13" />relieving the wants of Christ’s people; devoted to hospitality.
<verse eID="Rom.12.13" />
<verse sID="Rom.12.14" osisID="Rom.12.14" n="14" />Bless your persecutors – bless and never curse.
<verse eID="Rom.12.14" />
<verse sID="Rom.12.15" osisID="Rom.12.15" n="15" />Rejoice with those who are rejoicing, and weep with those who are weeping.
<verse eID="Rom.12.15" />
<verse sID="Rom.12.16" osisID="Rom.12.16" n="16" />Let the same spirit of sympathy animate you all, not a spirit of pride; enjoy the company of ordinary people. Do not think too highly of yourselves.
<verse eID="Rom.12.16" />
<verse sID="Rom.12.17" osisID="Rom.12.17" n="17" />Never return injury for injury. Aim at doing what everyone will recognize as honorable.
<verse eID="Rom.12.17" />
<verse sID="Rom.12.18" osisID="Rom.12.18" n="18" />If it is possible, as far as rests with you, live peaceably with everyone.
<verse eID="Rom.12.18" />
<verse sID="Rom.12.19" osisID="Rom.12.19" n="19" />Never avenge yourselves, dear friends, but make way for the wrath of God; for scripture declares – ‘“It is for me to avenge, I will requite,” says the Lord.’
<verse eID="Rom.12.19" />
<verse sID="Rom.12.20" osisID="Rom.12.20" n="20" />Rather – ‘If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him to drink. By doing this you will heap coals of fire on his head.’
<verse eID="Rom.12.20" />
<verse sID="Rom.12.21" osisID="Rom.12.21" n="21" />Never be conquered by evil, but conquer evil with good.
<verse eID="Rom.12.21" />
<chapter eID="Rom.12" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Rom.13" osisID="Rom.13" n="13" />
<verse sID="Rom.13.1" osisID="Rom.13.1" n="1" />Let everyone obey the supreme Authorities. For no Authority exists except by the will of God, and the existing Authorities have been appointed by God.
<verse eID="Rom.13.1" />
<verse sID="Rom.13.2" osisID="Rom.13.2" n="2" />Therefore he who sets himself against the authorities is resisting God’s appointment, and those who resist will bring a judgment on themselves.
<verse eID="Rom.13.2" />
<verse sID="Rom.13.3" osisID="Rom.13.3" n="3" />A good action has nothing to fear from Rulers; a bad action has. Do you want to have no reason to fear the Authorities? Then do what is good, and you will win their praise.
<verse eID="Rom.13.3" />
<verse sID="Rom.13.4" osisID="Rom.13.4" n="4" />For they are God’s servants appointed for your good. But, if you do what is wrong, you may well be afraid; for the sword they carry is not without meaning! They are God’s servants to inflict his punishments on those who do wrong.
<verse eID="Rom.13.4" />
<verse sID="Rom.13.5" osisID="Rom.13.5" n="5" />You are bound, therefore, to obey, not only through fear of God’s punishments, but also as a matter of conscience.
<verse eID="Rom.13.5" />
<verse sID="Rom.13.6" osisID="Rom.13.6" n="6" />This, too, is the reason for your paying taxes; for the officials are God’s officers, devoting themselves to this special work.
<verse eID="Rom.13.6" />
<verse sID="Rom.13.7" osisID="Rom.13.7" n="7" />In all cases pay what is due from you – tribute where tribute is due, taxes where taxes are due, respect where respect is due, and honor where honor is due.
<verse eID="Rom.13.7" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rom.13.8" osisID="Rom.13.8" n="8" />Owe nothing to anyone except love; for they who love their neighbor have satisfied the Law.
<verse eID="Rom.13.8" />
<verse sID="Rom.13.9" osisID="Rom.13.9" n="9" />The commandments, ‘You must not commit adultery, You must not kill, You must not steal, You must not covet,’ and whatever other commandment there is, are all summed up in the words – ‘You must love your neighbor as you love yourself.’
<verse eID="Rom.13.9" />
<verse sID="Rom.13.10" osisID="Rom.13.10" n="10" />Love never wrongs a neighbor. Therefore love fully satisfies the Law.
<verse eID="Rom.13.10" />
<verse sID="Rom.13.11" osisID="Rom.13.11" n="11" />This I say, because you know the crisis that we have reached, for the time has already come for you to rouse yourselves from sleep; our salvation is nearer now than when we accepted the faith.
<verse eID="Rom.13.11" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rom.13.12" osisID="Rom.13.12" n="12" />The night is almost gone; the day is near. Therefore let us have done with the deeds of darkness, and arm ourselves with the weapons of light.
<verse eID="Rom.13.12" />
<verse sID="Rom.13.13" osisID="Rom.13.13" n="13" />Being in the light of day, let us live becomingly, not in revelry and drunkenness, not in lust and licentiousness, not in quarreling and jealousy.
<verse eID="Rom.13.13" />
<verse sID="Rom.13.14" osisID="Rom.13.14" n="14" />No! Arm yourselves with the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ, and spend no thought on your earthly nature, to satisfy its cravings.

<verse sID="Rom.14.1" osisID="Rom.14.1" n="1" />As for those whose faith is weak, always receive them as friends, but not for the purpose of passing judgment on their scruples.
<verse eID="Rom.14.1" />
<verse sID="Rom.14.2" osisID="Rom.14.2" n="2" />One person’s faith permits of their eating food of all kinds, while another whose faith is weak eats only vegetable food.
<verse eID="Rom.14.2" />
<verse sID="Rom.14.3" osisID="Rom.14.3" n="3" />The person who eats meat must not despise the person who abstains from it; nor must the person who abstains from eating meat pass judgment on the one who eats it, for God himself has received them.
<verse eID="Rom.14.3" />
<verse sID="Rom.14.4" osisID="Rom.14.4" n="4" />Who are you, that you should pass judgment on the servant of another? Their standing or falling concerns their own master. And stand they will, for their Master can enable them to stand.
<verse eID="Rom.14.4" />
<verse sID="Rom.14.5" osisID="Rom.14.5" n="5" />Again, one person considers some days to be more sacred than others, while another considers all days to be alike. Everyone ought to be fully convinced in their own mind.
<verse eID="Rom.14.5" />
<verse sID="Rom.14.6" osisID="Rom.14.6" n="6" />The person who observes a day, observes it to the Master’s honor. They, again, who eat meat eat it to the Master’s honor, for they give thanks to God; while the person who abstains from it abstains from it to the Master’s honor, and also gives thanks to God.
<verse eID="Rom.14.6" />
<verse sID="Rom.14.7" osisID="Rom.14.7" n="7" />There is not one of us whose life concerns ourselves alone, and not one of us whose death concerns ourself alone;
<verse eID="Rom.14.7" />
<verse sID="Rom.14.8" osisID="Rom.14.8" n="8" />for, if we live, our life is for the Master, and, if we die, our death is for the Master. Whether, then, we live or die we belong to the Master.
<verse eID="Rom.14.8" />
<verse sID="Rom.14.9" osisID="Rom.14.9" n="9" />The purpose for which Christ died and came back to life was this – that he might be Lord over both the dead and the living.
<verse eID="Rom.14.9" />
<verse sID="Rom.14.10" osisID="Rom.14.10" n="10" />I would ask the one ‘Why do you judge other followers of the Lord?’ And I would ask the other ‘Why do you despise them?’ For we will all stand before the court of God.
<verse eID="Rom.14.10" />
<verse sID="Rom.14.11" osisID="Rom.14.11" n="11" />For scripture says – ‘“As surely as I live,” says the Lord, “every knee will bend before me and every tongue will praise God.”’
<verse eID="Rom.14.11" />
<verse sID="Rom.14.12" osisID="Rom.14.12" n="12" />So, then, each one of us will have to render account of himself to God.
<verse eID="Rom.14.12" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rom.14.13" osisID="Rom.14.13" n="13" />Let us, then, cease to judge one another. Rather let this be your resolve – never to place a stumbling-block or an obstacle in the way of a fellow follower of the Lord.
<verse eID="Rom.14.13" />
<verse sID="Rom.14.14" osisID="Rom.14.14" n="14" />Through my union with the Lord Jesus, I know and am persuaded that nothing is defiling in itself. A thing is ‘defiling’ only to the person who holds it to be so.
<verse eID="Rom.14.14" />
<verse sID="Rom.14.15" osisID="Rom.14.15" n="15" />If, for the sake of what you eat, you wound your fellow follower’s feelings, your life has ceased to be ruled by love. Do not, by what you eat, ruin someone for whom Christ died!
<verse eID="Rom.14.15" />
<verse sID="Rom.14.16" osisID="Rom.14.16" n="16" />Do not let what is right for you become a matter of reproach.
<verse eID="Rom.14.16" />
<verse sID="Rom.14.17" osisID="Rom.14.17" n="17" />For the kingdom of God does not consist of eating and drinking, but of righteousness and peace and gladness through the presence of the Holy Spirit.
<verse eID="Rom.14.17" />
<verse sID="Rom.14.18" osisID="Rom.14.18" n="18" />The person who serves the Christ in this way pleases God, and wins the approval of their fellows.
<verse eID="Rom.14.18" />
<verse sID="Rom.14.19" osisID="Rom.14.19" n="19" />Therefore our efforts should be directed towards all that makes for peace and the mutual building up of character.
<verse eID="Rom.14.19" />
<verse sID="Rom.14.20" osisID="Rom.14.20" n="20" />Do not undo God’s work for the sake of what you eat. Though everything is ‘clean,’ yet, if a person eats so as to put a stumbling-block in the way of others, they do wrong.
<verse eID="Rom.14.20" />
<verse sID="Rom.14.21" osisID="Rom.14.21" n="21" />The right course is to abstain from meat or wine or, indeed, anything that is a stumbling-block to your fellow follower of the Lord.
<verse eID="Rom.14.21" />
<verse sID="Rom.14.22" osisID="Rom.14.22" n="22" />As for yourself – keep this conviction of yours to yourself, as in the presence of God. Happy the person who never has to condemn themselves in regard to something they think right!
<verse eID="Rom.14.22" />
<verse sID="Rom.14.23" osisID="Rom.14.23" n="23" />The person, however, who has misgivings stands condemned if they still eat, because their doing so is not the result of faith. And anything not done as the result of faith is a sin.
<verse eID="Rom.14.23" />
<chapter eID="Rom.14" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Rom.15" osisID="Rom.15" n="15" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.1" osisID="Rom.15.1" n="1" />We, the strong, ought to take on our own shoulders the weaknesses of those who are not strong, and not merely to please ourselves.
<verse eID="Rom.15.1" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.2" osisID="Rom.15.2" n="2" />Let each of us please our neighbor for our neighbor’s good, to help in the building up of their character.
<verse eID="Rom.15.2" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.3" osisID="Rom.15.3" n="3" />Even the Christ did not please himself! On the contrary, as scripture says of him – ‘The reproaches of those who were reproaching you fell upon me.’
<verse eID="Rom.15.3" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.4" osisID="Rom.15.4" n="4" />Whatever was written in the scriptures in days gone by was written for our instruction, so that, through patient endurance, and through the encouragement drawn from the scriptures, we might hold fast to our hope.
<verse eID="Rom.15.4" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.5" osisID="Rom.15.5" n="5" />And may God, the giver of this patience and this encouragement, grant you to be united in sympathy in Christ,
<verse eID="Rom.15.5" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.6" osisID="Rom.15.6" n="6" />so that with one heart and one voice you may praise the God and Father of Jesus Christ, our Lord.
<verse eID="Rom.15.6" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.7" osisID="Rom.15.7" n="7" />Therefore always receive one another as friends, just as the Christ himself received us, to the glory of God.
<verse eID="Rom.15.7" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.8" osisID="Rom.15.8" n="8" />For I tell you that Christ, in vindication of God’s truthfulness, has become a minister of the covenant of circumcision, so that he may fulfill the promises made to our ancestors,
<verse eID="Rom.15.8" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.9" osisID="Rom.15.9" n="9" />and that the Gentiles also may praise God for his mercy. As scripture says – ‘Therefore will I make acknowledgment to you among the Gentiles and sing in honor of your name.’
<verse eID="Rom.15.9" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.10" osisID="Rom.15.10" n="10" />And again it says – ‘Rejoice, you Gentiles, with God’s people.’
<verse eID="Rom.15.10" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.11" osisID="Rom.15.11" n="11" />And yet again – ‘Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles, and let all Peoples sing his praises.’
<verse eID="Rom.15.11" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.12" osisID="Rom.15.12" n="12" />Again, Isaiah says – ‘There will be a Scion of the house of Jesse, One who is to arise to rule the Gentiles; on him will the Gentiles rest their hopes.’
<verse eID="Rom.15.12" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.13" osisID="Rom.15.13" n="13" />May God, who inspires our hope, grant you perfect happiness and peace in your faith, until you are filled with this hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.
<verse eID="Rom.15.13" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rom.15.14" osisID="Rom.15.14" n="14" />I am persuaded, my friends – yes, I Paul, with regard to you – that you are yourselves full of kindness, furnished with all Christian learning, and well able to give advice to one another.
<verse eID="Rom.15.14" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.15" osisID="Rom.15.15" n="15" />But in parts of this letter I have expressed myself somewhat boldly – by way of refreshing your memories –
<verse eID="Rom.15.15" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.16" osisID="Rom.15.16" n="16" />because of the charge with which God has entrusted me, that I should be an assistant of Christ Jesus to go to the Gentiles – that I should act as a priest of God’s good news, so that the offering up of the Gentiles may be an acceptable sacrifice, consecrated by the Holy Spirit.
<verse eID="Rom.15.16" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.17" osisID="Rom.15.17" n="17" />It is, then, through my union with Christ Jesus that I have a proud confidence in my work for God.
<verse eID="Rom.15.17" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.18" osisID="Rom.15.18" n="18" />For I will not dare to speak of anything but what Christ has done through me to win the obedience of the Gentiles –
<verse eID="Rom.15.18" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.19" osisID="Rom.15.19" n="19" />by my words and actions, through the power displayed in signs and marvels, and through the power of the Holy Spirit. And so, starting from Jerusalem and going as far as Illyria, I have told in full the good news of the Christ;
<verse eID="Rom.15.19" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.20" osisID="Rom.15.20" n="20" />yet always with the ambition to tell the good news where Christ’s name had not previously been heard, so as to avoid building on another’s foundations.
<verse eID="Rom.15.20" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.21" osisID="Rom.15.21" n="21" />But as scripture says – ‘They to whom he had never been proclaimed will see; and they who have never heard will understand!’
</p>
<verse eID="Rom.15.21" />
<!-- s --><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>
<verse sID="Rom.15.22" osisID="Rom.15.22" n="22" />That is why I have so often been prevented from coming to you.
<verse eID="Rom.15.22" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.23" osisID="Rom.15.23" n="23" />But now there are no further openings for me in these parts, and I have for several years been longing to come to you whenever I may be going to Spain.
<verse eID="Rom.15.23" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.24" osisID="Rom.15.24" n="24" />For my hope is to visit you on my journey, and then to be sent on my way by you, after I have first partly satisfied myself by seeing something of you.
<verse eID="Rom.15.24" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.25" osisID="Rom.15.25" n="25" />Just now, however, I am on my way to Jerusalem, to take help to Christ’s people there.
<verse eID="Rom.15.25" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.26" osisID="Rom.15.26" n="26" />For Macedonia and Greece have been glad to make a collection for the poor among Christ’s people at Jerusalem.
<verse eID="Rom.15.26" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.27" osisID="Rom.15.27" n="27" />Yes, they were glad to do so; and indeed it is a duty which they owe to them. For the Gentile converts who have shared their spiritual blessings are in duty bound to minister to them in the things of this world.
<verse eID="Rom.15.27" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.28" osisID="Rom.15.28" n="28" />When I have settled this matter, and have secured to the poor at Jerusalem the enjoyment of these benefits, I will go, by way of you, to Spain.
<verse eID="Rom.15.28" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.29" osisID="Rom.15.29" n="29" />And I know that, when I come to you, it will be with a full measure of blessing from Christ.
<verse eID="Rom.15.29" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rom.15.30" osisID="Rom.15.30" n="30" />I beg you, then, friends, by Jesus Christ, our Lord, and by the love inspired by the Spirit, to join me in earnest prayer to God on my behalf.
<verse eID="Rom.15.30" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.31" osisID="Rom.15.31" n="31" />Pray that I may be rescued from those in Judea who reject the faith, and that the help which I am taking to Jerusalem may prove acceptable to Christ’s people;
<verse eID="Rom.15.31" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.32" osisID="Rom.15.32" n="32" />so that, God willing, I may be able to come to you with a joyful heart, and enjoy some rest among you.
<verse eID="Rom.15.32" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.33" osisID="Rom.15.33" n="33" />May God, the giver of peace, be with you all. Amen.

<verse sID="Rom.16.1" osisID="Rom.16.1" n="1" />I commend to your care our sister, Phoebe, who is an assistant of the church at Cenchreae;
<verse eID="Rom.16.1" />
<verse sID="Rom.16.2" osisID="Rom.16.2" n="2" />and I ask you to give her a Christian welcome – one worthy of Christ’s people – and to aid her in any matter in which she may need your assistance. She has proved herself a staunch friend and protector and to many others.
<verse eID="Rom.16.2" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rom.16.3" osisID="Rom.16.3" n="3" />Give my greeting to Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in the cause of Christ Jesus,
<verse eID="Rom.16.3" />
<verse sID="Rom.16.4" osisID="Rom.16.4" n="4" />who risked their own lives to save mine. It is not I alone who thank them, but all the churches among the Gentiles thank them also.
<verse eID="Rom.16.4" />
<verse sID="Rom.16.5" osisID="Rom.16.5" n="5" />Give my greeting, also, to the church that meets at their house, as well as to my dear friend Epaenetus, one of the first in Roman Asia to believe in Christ;
<verse eID="Rom.16.5" />
<verse sID="Rom.16.6" osisID="Rom.16.6" n="6" />to Mary, who worked hard for you;

<verse sID="Rom.16.7" osisID="Rom.16.7" n="7" />to Andronicus and Junia, fellow Jews and once my fellow prisoners, who are people of note among the apostles, and who became Christians before I did;

<verse sID="Rom.16.12" osisID="Rom.16.12" n="12" />to Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who have worked hard for the Master; to my dear friend Persis, for she has done much hard work for the Master;

<verse sID="Rom.16.15" osisID="Rom.16.15" n="15" />also to Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and to all Christ’s people who are with them.
<verse eID="Rom.16.15" />
<verse sID="Rom.16.16" osisID="Rom.16.16" n="16" />Greet one another with a sacred kiss. All the churches of the Christ send you greetings.

<verse sID="Rom.16.17" osisID="Rom.16.17" n="17" />I beg you, friends, to be on your guard against people who, by disregarding the teaching which you received, cause divisions and create difficulties; dissociate yourselves from them.
<verse eID="Rom.16.17" />
<verse sID="Rom.16.18" osisID="Rom.16.18" n="18" />For such persons are not serving Christ, our Master, but are slaves to their own appetites; and, by their smooth words and flattery, they deceive simple-minded people.
<verse eID="Rom.16.18" />
<verse sID="Rom.16.19" osisID="Rom.16.19" n="19" />Everyone has heard of your ready obedience. It is true that I am very happy about you, but I want you to be well versed in all that is good, and innocent of all that is bad.
<verse eID="Rom.16.19" />
<verse sID="Rom.16.20" osisID="Rom.16.20" n="20" />And God, the giver of peace, will before long crush Satan under your feet.

<!-- s --><title>Introduction</title>
<p>
<verse sID="1Cor.1.1" osisID="1Cor.1.1" n="1" />To the church of God in Corinth, to those who have been consecrated by union with Christ Jesus and called to become his people, and also to all, wherever they may be, who invoke the name of our Lord Jesus Christ – their Master and ours,
<verse eID="1Cor.1.1" />
<verse sID="1Cor.1.2" osisID="1Cor.1.2" n="2" />from Paul, who has been called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and from Sosthenes, our fellow follower of the Lord.
<verse eID="1Cor.1.2" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Cor.1.3" osisID="1Cor.1.3" n="3" />May God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace.
<verse eID="1Cor.1.3" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Cor.1.4" osisID="1Cor.1.4" n="4" />I always thank God about you for the blessing bestowed on you in Christ Jesus.
<verse eID="1Cor.1.4" />
<verse sID="1Cor.1.5" osisID="1Cor.1.5" n="5" />For through union with him you were enriched in every way – in your power to preach, and in your knowledge of the truth;
<verse eID="1Cor.1.5" />
<verse sID="1Cor.1.6" osisID="1Cor.1.6" n="6" />and so became yourselves a confirmation of my testimony to the Christ.
<verse eID="1Cor.1.6" />
<verse sID="1Cor.1.7" osisID="1Cor.1.7" n="7" />There is no gift in which you are deficient, while waiting for the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.
<verse eID="1Cor.1.7" />
<verse sID="1Cor.1.8" osisID="1Cor.1.8" n="8" />And God himself will strengthen you to the end, so that at the day of our Lord Jesus Christ you may be found blameless.
<verse eID="1Cor.1.8" />
<verse sID="1Cor.1.9" osisID="1Cor.1.9" n="9" />God will not fail you, and it is he who called you into communion with his Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord.

<!-- s --><title>The State of the Church at Corinth</title>
<p>
<verse sID="1Cor.1.10" osisID="1Cor.1.10" n="10" />But I appeal to you, my friends, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to agree in what you profess, and not to allow divisions to exist among you, but to be united – of one mind and of one opinion.
<verse eID="1Cor.1.10" />
<verse sID="1Cor.1.11" osisID="1Cor.1.11" n="11" />For I have been informed, my friends, by the members of Chloe’s household, that party feeling exists among you.
<verse eID="1Cor.1.11" />
<verse sID="1Cor.1.12" osisID="1Cor.1.12" n="12" />I mean this: that every one of you says either ‘I follow Paul,’ or ‘I Apollos,’ or ‘I Cephas,’ or ‘I Christ.’
<verse eID="1Cor.1.12" />
<verse sID="1Cor.1.13" osisID="1Cor.1.13" n="13" />You have torn the Christ in pieces! Was it Paul who was crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?
<verse eID="1Cor.1.13" />
<verse sID="1Cor.1.14" osisID="1Cor.1.14" n="14" />I am thankful that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius,
<verse eID="1Cor.1.14" />
<verse sID="1Cor.1.15" osisID="1Cor.1.15" n="15" />so that no one can say that you were baptized in my name.
<verse eID="1Cor.1.15" />
<verse sID="1Cor.1.16" osisID="1Cor.1.16" n="16" />I baptized also the household of Stephanas. I do not know that I baptized anyone else.
<verse eID="1Cor.1.16" />
<verse sID="1Cor.1.17" osisID="1Cor.1.17" n="17" />My mission from Christ was not to baptize, but to tell the good news; not, however, in the language of philosophy, in case the cross of the Christ should be robbed of its meaning.

<verse sID="1Cor.1.18" osisID="1Cor.1.18" n="18" />The message of the cross is indeed mere folly to those who are in the path to ruin, but to us who are in the path of salvation it is the power of God.
<verse eID="1Cor.1.18" />
<verse sID="1Cor.1.19" osisID="1Cor.1.19" n="19" />For scripture says –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘I will bring the philosophy of the philosophers to naught, and the shrewdness of the shrewd I will bring to nothing.’ <verse eID="1Cor.1.19" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="1Cor.1.20" osisID="1Cor.1.20" n="20" />Where is the philosopher? Where the teacher of the Law? Where the disputant of today? Has not God shown the world’s philosophy to be folly?
<verse eID="1Cor.1.20" />
<verse sID="1Cor.1.21" osisID="1Cor.1.21" n="21" />For since the world, in God’s wisdom, did not by its philosophy learn to know God, God saw fit, by the ‘folly’ of our proclamation, to save those who believe in Christ!
<verse eID="1Cor.1.21" />
<verse sID="1Cor.1.22" osisID="1Cor.1.22" n="22" />While Jews ask for miraculous signs, and Greeks study philosophy,
<verse eID="1Cor.1.22" />
<verse sID="1Cor.1.23" osisID="1Cor.1.23" n="23" />we are proclaiming Christ crucified! – to the Jews an obstacle, to the Gentiles mere folly,
<verse eID="1Cor.1.23" />
<verse sID="1Cor.1.24" osisID="1Cor.1.24" n="24" />but to those who have received the call, whether Jews or Greeks, Christ, the power of God and the wisdom of God!
<verse eID="1Cor.1.24" />
<verse sID="1Cor.1.25" osisID="1Cor.1.25" n="25" />For God’s ‘folly’ is wiser than people, and God’s ‘weakness’ is stronger than people.
<verse eID="1Cor.1.25" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Cor.1.26" osisID="1Cor.1.26" n="26" />Look at the facts of your call, friends. There are not many among you who are wise, as people reckon wisdom, not many who are influential, not many who are high-born;
<verse eID="1Cor.1.26" />
<verse sID="1Cor.1.27" osisID="1Cor.1.27" n="27" />but God chose what the world counts foolish to put its wise to shame, and God chose what the world counts weak to put its strong to shame,
<verse eID="1Cor.1.27" />
<verse sID="1Cor.1.28" osisID="1Cor.1.28" n="28" />and God chose what the world counts poor and insignificant – things that to it are unreal – to bring its ‘realities’ to nothing,
<verse eID="1Cor.1.28" />
<verse sID="1Cor.1.29" osisID="1Cor.1.29" n="29" />so that in his presence no one should boast.
<verse eID="1Cor.1.29" />
<verse sID="1Cor.1.30" osisID="1Cor.1.30" n="30" />But you, by your union with Christ Jesus, belong to God; and Christ, by God’s will, became not only our wisdom, but also our righteousness, holiness, and deliverance,
<verse eID="1Cor.1.30" />
<verse sID="1Cor.1.31" osisID="1Cor.1.31" n="31" />so that – in the words of scripture –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘Whoever boasts should boast of the Lord!’
<verse eID="1Cor.1.31" /></l></lg>
<chapter eID="1Cor.1" />
<chapter sID="1Cor.2" osisID="1Cor.2" n="2" />
<p>
<verse sID="1Cor.2.1" osisID="1Cor.2.1" n="1" />For my own part, friends, when I came to you, it was with no display of eloquence or philosophy that I came to tell the hidden purpose of God;
<verse eID="1Cor.2.1" />
<verse sID="1Cor.2.2" osisID="1Cor.2.2" n="2" />for I had determined that, while with you, I would forget everything Jesus Christ – and him crucified!
<verse eID="1Cor.2.2" />
<verse sID="1Cor.2.3" osisID="1Cor.2.3" n="3" />Indeed, when I came among you, I was weak, and full of fears, and in great anxiety.
<verse eID="1Cor.2.3" />
<verse sID="1Cor.2.4" osisID="1Cor.2.4" n="4" />My message and my proclamation were not delivered in the persuasive language of philosophy, but were accompanied by the manifestation of spiritual power,
<verse eID="1Cor.2.4" />
<verse sID="1Cor.2.5" osisID="1Cor.2.5" n="5" />so that your faith should be based, not on the human wisdom, but on the power of God.
<verse eID="1Cor.2.5" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Cor.2.6" osisID="1Cor.2.6" n="6" />Yet there is a philosophy that we teach to those whose faith is matured, but it is not the philosophy of today, or of the leaders of today – whose downfall is at hand.
<verse eID="1Cor.2.6" />
<verse sID="1Cor.2.7" osisID="1Cor.2.7" n="7" />No, it is a divine philosophy that we teach, one concerned with the hidden purpose of God – that long hidden philosophy which God, before time began, destined for our glory.
<verse eID="1Cor.2.7" />
<verse sID="1Cor.2.8" osisID="1Cor.2.8" n="8" />This philosophy is not known to any of the leaders of today; for, had they known it, they would not have crucified our glorified Lord.
<verse eID="1Cor.2.8" />
<verse sID="1Cor.2.9" osisID="1Cor.2.9" n="9" />It is what scripture speaks of as –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘What eye never saw, nor ear ever heard,</l>
<l level="1">what never entered people’s minds –</l>
<l level="2">even all that God has prepared for those who love him.’ <verse eID="1Cor.2.9" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="1Cor.2.10" osisID="1Cor.2.10" n="10" />Yet to us God revealed it through his Spirit; for the Spirit fathoms all things, even the inmost depths of God’s being.
<verse eID="1Cor.2.10" />
<verse sID="1Cor.2.11" osisID="1Cor.2.11" n="11" />For what person is there who knows what a person is, except the person’s own spirit within them? So, also, no one comprehends what God is, except the Spirit of God.
<verse eID="1Cor.2.11" />
<verse sID="1Cor.2.12" osisID="1Cor.2.12" n="12" />And as for us, it is not the spirit of the world that we have received, but the Spirit that comes from God, so that we may realize the blessings given to us by him.
<verse eID="1Cor.2.12" />
<verse sID="1Cor.2.13" osisID="1Cor.2.13" n="13" />And we speak of these gifts, not in language taught by human philosophy, but in language taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual things in spiritual words.
<verse eID="1Cor.2.13" />
<verse sID="1Cor.2.14" osisID="1Cor.2.14" n="14" />The merely intellectual person rejects the teaching of the Spirit of God; for to them it is mere folly; they cannot grasp it, because it is to be understood only by spiritual insight.
<verse eID="1Cor.2.14" />
<verse sID="1Cor.2.15" osisID="1Cor.2.15" n="15" />But the person with spiritual insight is able to understand everything, although they themselves are understood by no one.
<verse eID="1Cor.2.15" />
<verse sID="1Cor.2.16" osisID="1Cor.2.16" n="16" />For who has so comprehended the mind of the Lord as to be able to instruct him? We, however, have the mind of Christ.
<verse eID="1Cor.2.16" />
<chapter eID="1Cor.2" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="1Cor.3" osisID="1Cor.3" n="3" />
<verse sID="1Cor.3.1" osisID="1Cor.3.1" n="1" />But I, my friends, could not speak to you as people with spiritual insight, but only as worldly-minded – mere infants in the faith of Christ.
<verse eID="1Cor.3.1" />
<verse sID="1Cor.3.2" osisID="1Cor.3.2" n="2" />I fed you with milk, not with solid food, for you were not then able to take it.
</p>
<p>
No, and even now you are not able; you are still worldly.
<verse eID="1Cor.3.2" />
<verse sID="1Cor.3.3" osisID="1Cor.3.3" n="3" />While there exist among you jealousy and party feeling, is it not true that you are worldly, and are acting merely as other people do?
<verse eID="1Cor.3.3" />
<verse sID="1Cor.3.4" osisID="1Cor.3.4" n="4" />When one says ‘I follow Paul,’ and another ‘I follow Apollos,’ aren’t you like other people?
<verse eID="1Cor.3.4" />
<verse sID="1Cor.3.5" osisID="1Cor.3.5" n="5" />What, I ask, is Apollos? Or what is Paul? Servants through whom you were led to accept the faith; and that only as the Lord helped each of you.
<verse eID="1Cor.3.5" />
<verse sID="1Cor.3.6" osisID="1Cor.3.6" n="6" />I planted, and Apollos watered, but it was God who caused the growth.
<verse eID="1Cor.3.6" />
<verse sID="1Cor.3.7" osisID="1Cor.3.7" n="7" />Therefore neither the one who plants, nor the one who waters, counts for anything, but only God who causes the growth.
<verse eID="1Cor.3.7" />
<verse sID="1Cor.3.8" osisID="1Cor.3.8" n="8" />In this the person who plants and the person who waters are one; yet each will receive their own reward in proportion to their own labor.
<verse eID="1Cor.3.8" />
<verse sID="1Cor.3.9" osisID="1Cor.3.9" n="9" />For we are God’s fellow workers; you are God’s harvest field, God’s building.
<verse eID="1Cor.3.9" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Cor.3.10" osisID="1Cor.3.10" n="10" />In fulfillment of the charge which God had entrusted to me, I laid the foundation like a skillful master; but someone else is now building on it. Let everyone take care how they build;
<verse eID="1Cor.3.10" />
<verse sID="1Cor.3.11" osisID="1Cor.3.11" n="11" />for no one can lay any other foundation than the one already laid – Jesus Christ.
<verse eID="1Cor.3.11" />
<verse sID="1Cor.3.12" osisID="1Cor.3.12" n="12" />Whatever is used by those who build on this foundation, whether gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or straw,
<verse eID="1Cor.3.12" />
<verse sID="1Cor.3.13" osisID="1Cor.3.13" n="13" />the quality of each man’s work will become known, for the day will make it plain; because that day is to be ushered in with fire, and the fire itself will test the quality of every man’s work.
<verse eID="1Cor.3.13" />
<verse sID="1Cor.3.14" osisID="1Cor.3.14" n="14" />If anyone’s work, which they have built on that foundation, still remains, they will gain a reward.
<verse eID="1Cor.3.14" />
<verse sID="1Cor.3.15" osisID="1Cor.3.15" n="15" />If anyone’s work is burnt up, they will suffer loss; though they themselves will escape, but only as one who has passed through fire.
<verse eID="1Cor.3.15" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Cor.3.16" osisID="1Cor.3.16" n="16" />Don’t you know that you are God’s Temple, and that God’s Spirit has his home in you?
<verse eID="1Cor.3.16" />
<verse sID="1Cor.3.17" osisID="1Cor.3.17" n="17" />If any one destroys the Temple of God, God will destroy them; for the Temple of God is sacred, and so also are you.
<verse eID="1Cor.3.17" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Cor.3.18" osisID="1Cor.3.18" n="18" />Let no one deceive himself. If any one among you imagines that, as regards this world, they are wise, they should become a ‘fool,’ that they may become wise.
<verse eID="1Cor.3.18" />
<verse sID="1Cor.3.19" osisID="1Cor.3.19" n="19" />For in God’s sight this world’s wisdom is folly. Scripture tells of –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘One who catches the wise in their own craftiness,’ <verse eID="1Cor.3.19" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="1Cor.3.20" osisID="1Cor.3.20" n="20" />And it says again –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘The Lord sees how fruitless are the deliberations of the wise.’ <verse eID="1Cor.3.20" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="1Cor.3.21" osisID="1Cor.3.21" n="21" />Therefore let no one boast about people; for all things are yours –
<verse eID="1Cor.3.21" />
<verse sID="1Cor.3.22" osisID="1Cor.3.22" n="22" />Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or the present, or the future – all things are yours!
<verse eID="1Cor.3.22" />
<verse sID="1Cor.3.23" osisID="1Cor.3.23" n="23" />But you are Christ’s and Christ is God’s.
<verse eID="1Cor.3.23" />
<chapter eID="1Cor.3" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="1Cor.4" osisID="1Cor.4" n="4" />
<verse sID="1Cor.4.1" osisID="1Cor.4.1" n="1" />Let people look on us as Christ’s servants, and as stewards of the hidden truths of God.
<verse eID="1Cor.4.1" />
<verse sID="1Cor.4.2" osisID="1Cor.4.2" n="2" />Now what we look for in stewards is that they should be trustworthy.
<verse eID="1Cor.4.2" />
<verse sID="1Cor.4.3" osisID="1Cor.4.3" n="3" />But it weighs very little with me that I am judged by you or by any human tribunal. No, I do not even judge myself;
<verse eID="1Cor.4.3" />
<verse sID="1Cor.4.4" osisID="1Cor.4.4" n="4" />for, though I am conscious of nothing against myself, that does not prove me innocent. It is the Lord who is my judge.
<verse eID="1Cor.4.4" />
<verse sID="1Cor.4.5" osisID="1Cor.4.5" n="5" />Therefore do not pass judgment before the time, but wait until the Lord comes. He will throw light on what is now dark and obscure, and will reveal the motives in people’s minds; and then everyone will receive due praise from God.
<verse eID="1Cor.4.5" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Cor.4.6" osisID="1Cor.4.6" n="6" />All this, friends, I have, for your sakes, applied to Apollos and myself, so that, from our example, you may learn to observe the precept – ‘Keep to what is written,’ that none of you may speak boastfully of one teacher to the disparagement of another.
<verse eID="1Cor.4.6" />
<verse sID="1Cor.4.7" osisID="1Cor.4.7" n="7" />For who makes any one of you superior to others? And what have you that was not given you? But if you received it as a gift, why do you boast as if you had not?
<verse eID="1Cor.4.7" />
<verse sID="1Cor.4.8" osisID="1Cor.4.8" n="8" />Are you all so soon satisfied? Are you so soon rich? Have you begun to reign without us? Would indeed that you had, so that we also might reign with you!
<verse eID="1Cor.4.8" />
<verse sID="1Cor.4.9" osisID="1Cor.4.9" n="9" />For, as it seems to me, God has exhibited us, the apostles, last of all, as people doomed to death. We are made a spectacle to the universe, both to angels and to people!
<verse eID="1Cor.4.9" />
<verse sID="1Cor.4.10" osisID="1Cor.4.10" n="10" />We, for Christ’s sake, are fools, but you, by your union with Christ, are people of discernment. We are weak, but you are strong. You are honored, but we are despised.
<verse eID="1Cor.4.10" />
<verse sID="1Cor.4.11" osisID="1Cor.4.11" n="11" />To this very hour we go hungry, thirsty, and naked; we are beaten; we are homeless;
<verse eID="1Cor.4.11" />
<verse sID="1Cor.4.12" osisID="1Cor.4.12" n="12" />we work hard, toiling with our own hands. We meet abuse with blessings, we meet persecution with endurance,
<verse eID="1Cor.4.12" />
<verse sID="1Cor.4.13" osisID="1Cor.4.13" n="13" />we meet slander with gentle appeals. We have been treated as the scum of the earth, the vilest of the vile, to this very hour.
<verse eID="1Cor.4.13" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Cor.4.14" osisID="1Cor.4.14" n="14" />It is with no wish to shame you that I am writing like this; but to warn you as my own dear children.
<verse eID="1Cor.4.14" />
<verse sID="1Cor.4.15" osisID="1Cor.4.15" n="15" />Though you may have thousands of instructors in the faith of Christ, yet you have not many fathers. It was I who, through union with Christ Jesus, became your father by means of the good news.
<verse eID="1Cor.4.15" />
<verse sID="1Cor.4.16" osisID="1Cor.4.16" n="16" />Therefore I entreat you – Follow my example.
<verse eID="1Cor.4.16" />
<verse sID="1Cor.4.17" osisID="1Cor.4.17" n="17" />This is my reason for sending Timothy to you. He is my own dear faithful child in the Master’s service, and he will remind you of my methods of teaching the faith of Christ Jesus – methods which I follow everywhere in every church.
<verse eID="1Cor.4.17" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Cor.4.18" osisID="1Cor.4.18" n="18" />Some, I hear, are puffed up with pride, thinking that I am not coming to you.
<verse eID="1Cor.4.18" />
<verse sID="1Cor.4.19" osisID="1Cor.4.19" n="19" />But come to you I will, and that soon, if it please the Lord; and then I will find out, not what words these people use who are so puffed up, but what power they possess;
<verse eID="1Cor.4.19" />
<verse sID="1Cor.4.20" osisID="1Cor.4.20" n="20" />for the kingdom of God is based, not on words, but on power.
<verse eID="1Cor.4.20" />
<verse sID="1Cor.4.21" osisID="1Cor.4.21" n="21" />What do you wish? Am I to come to you with a rod, or in a loving and gentle spirit?
<verse eID="1Cor.4.21" />
<chapter eID="1Cor.4" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="1Cor.5" osisID="1Cor.5" n="5" />
<verse sID="1Cor.5.1" osisID="1Cor.5.1" n="1" />There is a wide-spread report respecting a case of immorality among you, and that, too, of a kind that does not occur even among the Gentiles – a man, I hear, is living with his father’s wife!
<verse eID="1Cor.5.1" />
<verse sID="1Cor.5.2" osisID="1Cor.5.2" n="2" />Instead of grieving over it and taking steps for the expulsion of the man who has done this thing, is it possible that you are still puffed up?
<verse eID="1Cor.5.2" />
<verse sID="1Cor.5.3" osisID="1Cor.5.3" n="3" />For I myself, though absent in body, have been present with you in spirit, and in the name of our Lord Jesus I have already passed judgment, just as if I had been present, on the man who has acted in this way.
<verse eID="1Cor.5.3" />
<verse sID="1Cor.5.4" osisID="1Cor.5.4" n="4" />I have decided – having been present in spirit at your meetings, when the power of the Lord Jesus was with us –
<verse eID="1Cor.5.4" />
<verse sID="1Cor.5.5" osisID="1Cor.5.5" n="5" />to deliver such a man as this over to Satan, that what is sensual in him may be destroyed, so that his spirit may be saved at the day of the Lord.
<verse eID="1Cor.5.5" />
<verse sID="1Cor.5.6" osisID="1Cor.5.6" n="6" />Your boasting is unseemly. Don’t you know that even a little leaven leavens all the dough?
<verse eID="1Cor.5.6" />
<verse sID="1Cor.5.7" osisID="1Cor.5.7" n="7" />Get rid entirely of the old leaven, so that you may be like new dough – free from leaven, as in truth you are. For our passover lamb is already sacrificed – Christ himself;
<verse eID="1Cor.5.7" />
<verse sID="1Cor.5.8" osisID="1Cor.5.8" n="8" />therefore let us keep our festival, not with the leaven of former days, nor with the leaven of vice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
<verse eID="1Cor.5.8" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Cor.5.9" osisID="1Cor.5.9" n="9" />I told you, in my letter, not to associate with immoral people –
<verse eID="1Cor.5.9" />
<verse sID="1Cor.5.10" osisID="1Cor.5.10" n="10" />not, of course, meaning people of the world who are in immoral, or who are covetous and grasping, or who worship idols; for then you would have to leave the world altogether.
<verse eID="1Cor.5.10" />
<verse sID="1Cor.5.11" osisID="1Cor.5.11" n="11" />But, as things are, I say that you are not to associate with anyone who, although a follower of Christ in name, is immoral, or covetous, or an idolater, or abusive, or a drunkard, or grasping – no, not even to sit down to eat with such people.
<verse eID="1Cor.5.11" />
<verse sID="1Cor.5.12" osisID="1Cor.5.12" n="12" />What have I to do with judging those outside the church? Is it not for you to judge those who are within the church,
<verse eID="1Cor.5.12" />
<verse sID="1Cor.5.13" osisID="1Cor.5.13" n="13" />while God judges those who are outside? Put away the wicked from among you.

</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="1Cor.6" osisID="1Cor.6" n="6" />
<verse sID="1Cor.6.1" osisID="1Cor.6.1" n="1" />Can it be that, when one of you has a dispute with another, they dare to have their case tried before the heathen, instead of before Christ’s people?
<verse eID="1Cor.6.1" />
<verse sID="1Cor.6.2" osisID="1Cor.6.2" n="2" />Don’t you know that Christ’s people will try the world? And if the world is to be tried by you, are you unfit to try the most trivial cases?
<verse eID="1Cor.6.2" />
<verse sID="1Cor.6.3" osisID="1Cor.6.3" n="3" />Don’t you know that we are to try angels – to say nothing of the affairs of this life?
<verse eID="1Cor.6.3" />
<verse sID="1Cor.6.4" osisID="1Cor.6.4" n="4" />Why, then, if you have cases relating to the affairs of this life, do you set to try them those who carry no weight with the church? To your shame I ask it.
<verse eID="1Cor.6.4" />
<verse sID="1Cor.6.5" osisID="1Cor.6.5" n="5" />Can it be that there is not one among you wise enough to decide between two of their fellow followers?
<verse eID="1Cor.6.5" />
<verse sID="1Cor.6.6" osisID="1Cor.6.6" n="6" />Must a follower sue a fellow follower? In front of unbelievers?
<verse eID="1Cor.6.6" />
<verse sID="1Cor.6.7" osisID="1Cor.6.7" n="7" />To begin with, it is undoubtedly a loss to you to have lawsuits with one another. Why not rather let yourselves be wronged? Why not rather let yourselves be cheated?
<verse eID="1Cor.6.7" />
<verse sID="1Cor.6.8" osisID="1Cor.6.8" n="8" />Instead of this, you wrong and cheat others yourselves – yes, even other followers!
<verse eID="1Cor.6.8" />
<verse sID="1Cor.6.9" osisID="1Cor.6.9" n="9" />Don’t you know that wrong-doers will have no share in God’s kingdom? Do not be deceived. No one who is immoral, or an idolater, or an adulterer, or licentious, or a sexual pervert,
<verse eID="1Cor.6.9" />
<verse sID="1Cor.6.10" osisID="1Cor.6.10" n="10" />or a thief, or covetous, or a drunkard, or abusive, or grasping, will have any share in God’s kingdom.
<verse eID="1Cor.6.10" />
<verse sID="1Cor.6.11" osisID="1Cor.6.11" n="11" />Such some of you used to be; but you washed yourselves clean. You became Christ’s people! You were pronounced righteous through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and through the Spirit of our God!
<verse eID="1Cor.6.11" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Cor.6.12" osisID="1Cor.6.12" n="12" />Everything is allowable for me! Yes, but everything is not profitable. Everything is allowable for me! Yes, but for my part, I will not let myself be enslaved by anything.
<verse eID="1Cor.6.12" />
<verse sID="1Cor.6.13" osisID="1Cor.6.13" n="13" />Food exists for the stomach, and the stomach for food; but God will put an end to both the one and the other. The body, however, exists, not for immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body;
<verse eID="1Cor.6.13" />
<verse sID="1Cor.6.14" osisID="1Cor.6.14" n="14" />and, as God has raised the Lord, so he will raise up us also by the exercise of his power.
<verse eID="1Cor.6.14" />
<verse sID="1Cor.6.15" osisID="1Cor.6.15" n="15" />Don’t you know that your bodies are Christ’s members? Am I, then, to take the members that belong to the Christ and make them the members of a prostitute? Heaven forbid!
<verse eID="1Cor.6.15" />
<verse sID="1Cor.6.16" osisID="1Cor.6.16" n="16" />Or don’t you know that a man who unites himself with a prostitute is one with her in body (for ‘the two,’ it is said, ‘will become one’);
<verse eID="1Cor.6.16" />
<verse sID="1Cor.6.17" osisID="1Cor.6.17" n="17" />while a man who is united with the Lord is one with him in spirit?
<verse eID="1Cor.6.17" />
<verse sID="1Cor.6.18" osisID="1Cor.6.18" n="18" />Shun all immorality. Every other sin that people commit is something outside the body; but an immoral person sins against their own body.
<verse eID="1Cor.6.18" />
<verse sID="1Cor.6.19" osisID="1Cor.6.19" n="19" />Again, don’t you know that your body is a shrine of the Holy Spirit that is within you – the Spirit which you have from God?
<verse eID="1Cor.6.19" />
<verse sID="1Cor.6.20" osisID="1Cor.6.20" n="20" />Moreover, you are not your own masters; you were bought, and the price was paid. Therefore, honor God in your bodies.
<verse eID="1Cor.6.20" />

<!-- s --><title>Answers to Questions Asked by the Church at Corinth</title>
<p>
<verse sID="1Cor.7.1" osisID="1Cor.7.1" n="1" />With reference to the subjects about which you wrote to me: It is good for a man to remain single.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.1" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.2" osisID="1Cor.7.2" n="2" />But, owing to the prevalence of immorality, I advise every man to have his own wife, and every woman her husband.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.2" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.3" osisID="1Cor.7.3" n="3" />A husband should give his wife her due, and a wife her husband.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.3" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.4" osisID="1Cor.7.4" n="4" />It is not the wife, but the husband, who exercises power over her body; and so, too, it is not the husband, but the wife, who exercises power over his body.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.4" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.5" osisID="1Cor.7.5" n="5" />Do not deprive each other of what is due – unless it is only for a time and by mutual consent, so that your minds may be free for prayer until you again live as man and wife – otherwise Satan might take advantage of your want of self-control and tempt you.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.5" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.6" osisID="1Cor.7.6" n="6" />I say this, however, as a concession, not as a command.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.6" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.7" osisID="1Cor.7.7" n="7" />I should wish everyone to be just what I am myself. But everyone has his own gift from God – one in one way, and one in another.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.7" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Cor.7.8" osisID="1Cor.7.8" n="8" />My advice, then, to those who are not married, and to widows, is this: It would be good for them to remain as I am myself.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.8" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.9" osisID="1Cor.7.9" n="9" />But, if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to be consumed with passion.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.9" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.10" osisID="1Cor.7.10" n="10" />To those who are married my direction is – yet it is not mine, but the Master’s – that a woman is not to leave her husband
<verse eID="1Cor.7.10" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.11" osisID="1Cor.7.11" n="11" />(If she has done so, she should remain as she is, or else be reconciled to her husband) and also that a man is not to divorce his wife.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.11" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.12" osisID="1Cor.7.12" n="12" />To all others I say – I, not the Master – If a follower of the Lord is married to a woman, who is an unbeliever but willing to live with him, he should not divorce her;
<verse eID="1Cor.7.12" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.13" osisID="1Cor.7.13" n="13" />and a woman who is married to a man, who is an unbeliever but willing to live with her, should not divorce her husband.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.13" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.14" osisID="1Cor.7.14" n="14" />For, through his wife, the husband who is an unbeliever has become associated with Christ’s people; and the wife who is an unbeliever has become associated with Christ’s people through the Lord’s follower whom she has married. Otherwise your children would be ‘defiled,’ but, as it is, they belong to Christ’s people.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.14" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.15" osisID="1Cor.7.15" n="15" />However, if the unbeliever wishes to be separated, let them be so. Under such circumstances neither is bound; God has called you to live in peace.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.15" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.16" osisID="1Cor.7.16" n="16" />How can you tell, wife, whether you may not save your husband? And how can you tell, husband, whether you may not save your wife?
<verse eID="1Cor.7.16" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Cor.7.17" osisID="1Cor.7.17" n="17" />In any case, a person should continue to live in the condition which the Lord has allotted to them, and in which they were when God called them. This is the rule that I lay down in every church.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.17" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.18" osisID="1Cor.7.18" n="18" />Was a man already circumcised when he was called? Then he should not efface his circumcision. Has a man been called when uncircumcised? Then he should not be circumcised.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.18" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.19" osisID="1Cor.7.19" n="19" />Circumcision is nothing; the want of it is nothing; but to keep the commands of God is everything.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.19" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.20" osisID="1Cor.7.20" n="20" />Let everyone remain in that condition of life in which they were when the call came to them.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.20" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.21" osisID="1Cor.7.21" n="21" />Were you a slave when you were called? Do not let that trouble you. No, even if you are able to gain your freedom, still do your best.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.21" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.22" osisID="1Cor.7.22" n="22" />For the person who was a slave when they were called to the master’s service is the Master’s freedman; so, too, the person who was free when called is Christ’s slave.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.22" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.23" osisID="1Cor.7.23" n="23" />You were bought, and the price was paid. Do not let yourselves become slaves to people.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.23" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.24" osisID="1Cor.7.24" n="24" />Friends, let everyone remain in the condition in which they were when they were called, in close communion with God.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.24" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Cor.7.25" osisID="1Cor.7.25" n="25" />With regard to unmarried women, I have no command from the Master to give you, but I tell you my opinion, and the Master in his mercy has made me worthy to be trusted.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.25" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.26" osisID="1Cor.7.26" n="26" />I think, then, that, in view of the time of suffering that has now come upon us, what I have already said is best – that a man should remain as he is.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.26" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.27" osisID="1Cor.7.27" n="27" />Are you married to a wife? Then do not seek to be separated. Are you separated from a wife? Then do not seek for a wife.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.27" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.28" osisID="1Cor.7.28" n="28" />Still, if you should marry, that is not wrong; nor, if a young woman marries, is that wrong. But those who marry will have much trouble to bear, and my wish is to spare you.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.28" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.29" osisID="1Cor.7.29" n="29" />What I mean, friends, is this – the time is short. Meanwhile, let those who have wives live as if they had none,
<verse eID="1Cor.7.29" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.30" osisID="1Cor.7.30" n="30" />those who are weeping as if not weeping, those who are rejoicing as if not rejoicing, those who buy as if not possessing,
<verse eID="1Cor.7.30" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.31" osisID="1Cor.7.31" n="31" />and those who use the good things of the world as using them sparingly; for this world as we see it is passing away.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.31" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.32" osisID="1Cor.7.32" n="32" />I want you to be free from anxiety. The unmarried man is anxious about the Master’s cause, desiring to please him;
<verse eID="1Cor.7.32" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.33" osisID="1Cor.7.33" n="33" />while the married man is anxious about worldly matters, desiring to please his wife;
<verse eID="1Cor.7.33" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.34" osisID="1Cor.7.34" n="34" />and so his interests are divided. Again, the unmarried woman, whether she is old or young, is anxious about the Master’s cause, striving to be pure both in body and in spirit, while the married woman is anxious about worldly matters, desiring to please her husband.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.34" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.35" osisID="1Cor.7.35" n="35" />I say this for your own benefit, not with any intention of putting a halter around your necks, but in order to secure for the Master seemly and constant devotion, free from all distraction.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.35" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Cor.7.36" osisID="1Cor.7.36" n="36" />If, however, a father thinks that he is not acting fairly by his unmarried daughter, when she is past her youth, and if under these circumstances her marriage ought to take place, he should act as he thinks right. He is doing nothing wrong – let the marriage take place.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.36" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.37" osisID="1Cor.7.37" n="37" />On the other hand, a father, who has definitely made up his mind, and is under no compulsion, but is free to carry out his own wishes, and who has come to the decision, in his own mind, to keep his unmarried daughter at home will be doing right.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.37" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.38" osisID="1Cor.7.38" n="38" />In short, the one who consents to his daughter’s marriage is doing right, and yet the other will be doing better.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.38" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Cor.7.39" osisID="1Cor.7.39" n="39" />A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives; but, if the husband should pass to his rest, the widow is free to marry anyone she wishes, provided he is a believer.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.39" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.40" osisID="1Cor.7.40" n="40" />Yet she will be happier if she remains as she is – in my opinion, for I think that I also have the Spirit of God.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.40" />
<chapter eID="1Cor.7" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="1Cor.8" osisID="1Cor.8" n="8" />
<verse sID="1Cor.8.1" osisID="1Cor.8.1" n="1" />With reference to food that has been offered in sacrifice to idols – We are aware that all of us have knowledge! Knowledge breeds conceit, while love builds up character.
<verse eID="1Cor.8.1" />
<verse sID="1Cor.8.2" osisID="1Cor.8.2" n="2" />If someone thinks that they know anything, they have not yet reached that knowledge which they ought to have reached.
<verse eID="1Cor.8.2" />
<verse sID="1Cor.8.3" osisID="1Cor.8.3" n="3" />On the other hand, if a person loves God, they are known by God.
<verse eID="1Cor.8.3" />
<verse sID="1Cor.8.4" osisID="1Cor.8.4" n="4" />With reference, then, to eating food that has been offered to idols – we are aware that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no God but one.
<verse eID="1Cor.8.4" />
<verse sID="1Cor.8.5" osisID="1Cor.8.5" n="5" />Even supposing that there are so-called ‘gods’ either in heaven or on earth – and there are many such ‘gods’ and ‘lords’ –
<verse eID="1Cor.8.5" />
<verse sID="1Cor.8.6" osisID="1Cor.8.6" n="6" />Yet for us there is only one God, the Father, from whom all things come (and for him we live), and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things come (and through him we live).
<verse eID="1Cor.8.6" />
<verse sID="1Cor.8.7" osisID="1Cor.8.7" n="7" />Still, it is not everyone that has this knowledge. Some people, because of their association with idols, continued down to the present time, eat the food as food offered to an idol; and their consciences, while still weak, are dulled.
<verse eID="1Cor.8.7" />
<verse sID="1Cor.8.8" osisID="1Cor.8.8" n="8" />What we eat, however, will not bring us nearer to God. We lose nothing by not eating this food, and we gain nothing by eating it.
<verse eID="1Cor.8.8" />
<verse sID="1Cor.8.9" osisID="1Cor.8.9" n="9" />But take care that this right of yours does not become in any way a stumbling-block to the weak.
<verse eID="1Cor.8.9" />
<verse sID="1Cor.8.10" osisID="1Cor.8.10" n="10" />For if someone should see you who possess this knowledge, feasting in an idol’s temple, will not their conscience, if they are weak, become so hardened that they, too, will eat food offered to idols?
<verse eID="1Cor.8.10" />
<verse sID="1Cor.8.11" osisID="1Cor.8.11" n="11" />And so, through this knowledge of yours, the weak person is ruined – someone for whose sake Christ died!
<verse eID="1Cor.8.11" />
<verse sID="1Cor.8.12" osisID="1Cor.8.12" n="12" />In this way, by sinning against your fellow followers of the Lord and injuring their consciences, while still weak, you sin against Christ.
<verse eID="1Cor.8.12" />
<verse sID="1Cor.8.13" osisID="1Cor.8.13" n="13" />Therefore, if what I eat makes a follower of the Lord fall, rather than make them fall, I will never eat meat again.
<verse eID="1Cor.8.13" />
<chapter eID="1Cor.8" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="1Cor.9" osisID="1Cor.9" n="9" />
<verse sID="1Cor.9.1" osisID="1Cor.9.1" n="1" />Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen our Lord Jesus? Aren’t you yourselves my work achieved in union with the Lord?
<verse eID="1Cor.9.1" />
<verse sID="1Cor.9.2" osisID="1Cor.9.2" n="2" />If I am not an apostle to others, yet at least I am to you; for you are the seal that stamps me as an apostle in union with the Lord.
<verse eID="1Cor.9.2" />
<verse sID="1Cor.9.3" osisID="1Cor.9.3" n="3" />The defense that I make to my critics is this:
<verse eID="1Cor.9.3" />
<verse sID="1Cor.9.4" osisID="1Cor.9.4" n="4" />Haven’t we a right to food and drink?
<verse eID="1Cor.9.4" />
<verse sID="1Cor.9.5" osisID="1Cor.9.5" n="5" />Haven’t we a right to take a wife with us, if she is a Christian, as the other apostles and the Master’s brothers and Cephas all do?
<verse eID="1Cor.9.5" />
<verse sID="1Cor.9.6" osisID="1Cor.9.6" n="6" />Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to give up working for our bread?
<verse eID="1Cor.9.6" />
<verse sID="1Cor.9.7" osisID="1Cor.9.7" n="7" />Does anyone ever serve as a soldier at his own expense? Does anyone plant a vineyard and not eat its produce? Or does anyone look after a herd and not drink the milk?
<verse eID="1Cor.9.7" />
<verse sID="1Cor.9.8" osisID="1Cor.9.8" n="8" />Am I, in all this, speaking only from the human standpoint? Does not the Law also say the same?
<verse eID="1Cor.9.8" />
<verse sID="1Cor.9.9" osisID="1Cor.9.9" n="9" />For in the Law of Moses it is said –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘You should not muzzle a bullock while it is treading out the grain.’ </l>
</lg>
<lb type="x-p" />
<p type="x-noindent">
Is it the bullocks that God is thinking of?
<verse eID="1Cor.9.9" />
<verse sID="1Cor.9.10" osisID="1Cor.9.10" n="10" />Or is not is said entirely for our sakes? Surely it was written for our sakes, for the plowman ought not to plow, nor the thrasher to thrash, without expecting a share of the grain.
<verse eID="1Cor.9.10" />
<verse sID="1Cor.9.11" osisID="1Cor.9.11" n="11" />Since we, then, sowed spiritual seed for you, is it too much that we should reap from you an earthly harvest?
<verse eID="1Cor.9.11" />
<verse sID="1Cor.9.12" osisID="1Cor.9.12" n="12" />If others share in this right over you, don’t we even more? Still we did not avail ourselves of this right. No, we endure anything rather than impede the progress of the good news of the Christ.
<verse eID="1Cor.9.12" />
<verse sID="1Cor.9.13" osisID="1Cor.9.13" n="13" />Don’t you know that those who do the work of the Temple live on what comes from the Temple, and that those who serve at the altar share the offerings with the altar?
<verse eID="1Cor.9.13" />
<verse sID="1Cor.9.14" osisID="1Cor.9.14" n="14" />So, too, the Master has appointed that those who tell the good news should get their living from the good news.
<verse eID="1Cor.9.14" />
<verse sID="1Cor.9.15" osisID="1Cor.9.15" n="15" />I, however, have not availed myself of any of these rights. I am not saying this to secure such an arrangement for myself; indeed, I would far rather die – Nobody will make my boast a vain one!
<verse eID="1Cor.9.15" />
<verse sID="1Cor.9.16" osisID="1Cor.9.16" n="16" />If I tell the good news, I have nothing to boast of, for I am compelled to do so. Woe is me if I do not tell it!
<verse eID="1Cor.9.16" />
<verse sID="1Cor.9.17" osisID="1Cor.9.17" n="17" />If I do this work willingly, I have a reward; but, if unwillingly, I have been charged to perform a duty.
<verse eID="1Cor.9.17" />
<verse sID="1Cor.9.18" osisID="1Cor.9.18" n="18" />What is my reward, then? To present the good news free of all cost, and so make but a sparing use of the rights which it gives me.
<verse eID="1Cor.9.18" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Cor.9.19" osisID="1Cor.9.19" n="19" />Although I was entirely free, yet, to win as many converts as possible, I made myself everyone’s slave.
<verse eID="1Cor.9.19" />
<verse sID="1Cor.9.20" osisID="1Cor.9.20" n="20" />To the Jews I became like a Jew, to win Jews. To those who are subject to Law I became like a man subject to Law – though I was not myself subject to Law – to win those who are subject to Law.
<verse eID="1Cor.9.20" />
<verse sID="1Cor.9.21" osisID="1Cor.9.21" n="21" />To those who have no Law I became like a man who has no Law – not that I am free from God’s Law; no, for I am under Christ’s Law – to win those who have no law.
<verse eID="1Cor.9.21" />
<verse sID="1Cor.9.22" osisID="1Cor.9.22" n="22" />To the weak I became weak, to win the weak. I have become all things to all people, so as at all costs to save some.
<verse eID="1Cor.9.22" />
<verse sID="1Cor.9.23" osisID="1Cor.9.23" n="23" />And I do everything for the sake of the good news, so that with them I may share in its blessings.
<verse eID="1Cor.9.23" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Cor.9.24" osisID="1Cor.9.24" n="24" />Don’t you know that on a racecourse, though all run, yet only one wins the prize? Run in such a way that you may win.
<verse eID="1Cor.9.24" />
<verse sID="1Cor.9.25" osisID="1Cor.9.25" n="25" />Every athlete exercises self-restraint in everything; they, indeed, for a crown that fades, we for one that is unfading.
<verse eID="1Cor.9.25" />
<verse sID="1Cor.9.26" osisID="1Cor.9.26" n="26" />I, therefore, run with no uncertain aim. I box – not like a man hitting the air.
<verse eID="1Cor.9.26" />
<verse sID="1Cor.9.27" osisID="1Cor.9.27" n="27" />No, I bruise my body and make it my slave, so that I, who have called others to the contest, will not myself be rejected.
<verse eID="1Cor.9.27" />
<chapter eID="1Cor.9" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="1Cor.10" osisID="1Cor.10" n="10" />
<verse sID="1Cor.10.1" osisID="1Cor.10.1" n="1" />I want you to bear in mind, friends, that all our ancestors were beneath the cloud, and all passed through the sea;
<verse eID="1Cor.10.1" />
<verse sID="1Cor.10.2" osisID="1Cor.10.2" n="2" />that in the cloud and in the sea they all underwent baptism as followers of Moses;
<verse eID="1Cor.10.2" />
<verse sID="1Cor.10.3" osisID="1Cor.10.3" n="3" />and that they all ate the same supernatural food,
<verse eID="1Cor.10.3" />
<verse sID="1Cor.10.4" osisID="1Cor.10.4" n="4" />and all drank the same supernatural water, for they used to drink from a supernatural rock which followed them, and that rock was the Christ.
<verse eID="1Cor.10.4" />
<verse sID="1Cor.10.5" osisID="1Cor.10.5" n="5" />Yet with most of them God was displeased; for they were struck down in the desert.
<verse eID="1Cor.10.5" />
<verse sID="1Cor.10.6" osisID="1Cor.10.6" n="6" />Now these things happened as warnings to us, to teach us not to long for evil things as our ancestors longed.
<verse eID="1Cor.10.6" />
<verse sID="1Cor.10.7" osisID="1Cor.10.7" n="7" />Do not become idolaters, as some of them became. Scripture says –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘The people sat down to eat and drink, and stood up to dance.’ <verse eID="1Cor.10.7" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="1Cor.10.8" osisID="1Cor.10.8" n="8" />Nor let us act immorally, as some of them acted, with the result that twenty-three thousand of them fell dead in a single day.
<verse eID="1Cor.10.8" />
<verse sID="1Cor.10.9" osisID="1Cor.10.9" n="9" />Nor let us try the patience of the Lord too far, as some of them tried it, with the result that they were, one after another, destroyed by the snakes.
<verse eID="1Cor.10.9" />
<verse sID="1Cor.10.10" osisID="1Cor.10.10" n="10" />And do not murmur, as some of them murmured, and so were destroyed by the angel of death.
<verse eID="1Cor.10.10" />
<verse sID="1Cor.10.11" osisID="1Cor.10.11" n="11" />These things happened to them by way of warning, and were recorded to serve as a caution to us, in whose days the close of the ages has come.
<verse eID="1Cor.10.11" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Cor.10.12" osisID="1Cor.10.12" n="12" />Therefore let the person who thinks that they stand take care that they do not fall.
<verse eID="1Cor.10.12" />
<verse sID="1Cor.10.13" osisID="1Cor.10.13" n="13" />No temptation has come upon you that is not common to all humanity. God will not fail you, and he will not allow you to be tempted beyond your strength; but, when he sends the temptation, he will also provide the way of escape, so that you may have strength to endure.
<verse eID="1Cor.10.13" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Cor.10.14" osisID="1Cor.10.14" n="14" />Therefore, my dear friends, shun the worship of idols.
<verse eID="1Cor.10.14" />
<verse sID="1Cor.10.15" osisID="1Cor.10.15" n="15" />I speak to you as man of discernment; form your own judgment about what I am saying.
<verse eID="1Cor.10.15" />
<verse sID="1Cor.10.16" osisID="1Cor.10.16" n="16" />In the cup of blessing which we bless, is not there a sharing in the blood of the Christ? And in the bread which we break, is not there a sharing in the body of the Christ?
<verse eID="1Cor.10.16" />
<verse sID="1Cor.10.17" osisID="1Cor.10.17" n="17" />The bread is one, and we, though many, are one body; for we all partake of that one bread.
<verse eID="1Cor.10.17" />
<verse sID="1Cor.10.18" osisID="1Cor.10.18" n="18" />Look at the people of Israel. Do not those who eat the sacrifices share with the altar?
<verse eID="1Cor.10.18" />
<verse sID="1Cor.10.19" osisID="1Cor.10.19" n="19" />What do I mean? That an offering made to an idol, or the idol itself, is anything?
<verse eID="1Cor.10.19" />
<verse sID="1Cor.10.20" osisID="1Cor.10.20" n="20" />No; what I say is that the sacrifices offered by the Gentiles are offered to demons and to a being who is no God, and I do not want you to share with demons.
<verse eID="1Cor.10.20" />
<verse sID="1Cor.10.21" osisID="1Cor.10.21" n="21" />You cannot drink both the Cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot partake at the Table of the Lord and at the table of demons.
<verse eID="1Cor.10.21" />
<verse sID="1Cor.10.22" osisID="1Cor.10.22" n="22" />Or are we to rouse the jealousy of the Lord? Are we stronger than he?
<verse eID="1Cor.10.22" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Cor.10.23" osisID="1Cor.10.23" n="23" />Everything is allowable! Yes, but everything is not profitable. Everything is allowable! Yes, but everything does not build up character.
<verse eID="1Cor.10.23" />
<verse sID="1Cor.10.24" osisID="1Cor.10.24" n="24" />A person must not study their own interests, but the interests of others.
<verse eID="1Cor.10.24" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Cor.10.25" osisID="1Cor.10.25" n="25" />Eat anything that is sold in the market, without making inquiries to satisfy your scruples;
<verse eID="1Cor.10.25" />
<verse sID="1Cor.10.26" osisID="1Cor.10.26" n="26" />for the earth, with all that is in it, belongs to the Lord.
<verse eID="1Cor.10.26" />
<verse sID="1Cor.10.27" osisID="1Cor.10.27" n="27" />If an unbeliever invites you to his house and you consent to go, eat anything that is put before you, without making inquiries to satisfy your scruples.
<verse eID="1Cor.10.27" />
<verse sID="1Cor.10.28" osisID="1Cor.10.28" n="28" />But, if anyone should say to you ‘This has been offered in sacrifice to an idol,’ then, for the sake of the speaker and his scruples, do not eat it.
<verse eID="1Cor.10.28" />
<verse sID="1Cor.10.29" osisID="1Cor.10.29" n="29" />I do not say your scruples, but his. For why should the freedom that I claim be condemned by the scruples of another?
<verse eID="1Cor.10.29" />
<verse sID="1Cor.10.30" osisID="1Cor.10.30" n="30" />If, for my part, I take the food thankfully, why should I be abused for eating that for which I give thanks?
<verse eID="1Cor.10.30" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Cor.10.31" osisID="1Cor.10.31" n="31" />Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do everything to the honor of God.
<verse eID="1Cor.10.31" />
<verse sID="1Cor.10.32" osisID="1Cor.10.32" n="32" />Do not cause offense either to Jews or Greeks or to the church of God;
<verse eID="1Cor.10.32" />
<verse sID="1Cor.10.33" osisID="1Cor.10.33" n="33" />for I, also, try to please everybody in everything, not seeking my own advantage, but do what is best for others, so that they may be saved.

<chapter eID="1Cor.10" />
<chapter sID="1Cor.11" osisID="1Cor.11" n="11" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.1" osisID="1Cor.11.1" n="1" />Imitate me, as I myself imitate Christ.
<verse eID="1Cor.11.1" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Cor.11.2" osisID="1Cor.11.2" n="2" />I praise you, indeed, because you never forget me, and are keeping my injunctions in mind, exactly as I laid them on you.
<verse eID="1Cor.11.2" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.3" osisID="1Cor.11.3" n="3" />But I am anxious that you should understand that the Christ is the head of every man, that man is the head of woman, and that God is the head of the Christ.
<verse eID="1Cor.11.3" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.4" osisID="1Cor.11.4" n="4" />Any man who keeps his head covered, when praying or preaching in public, dishonors him who is his head;
<verse eID="1Cor.11.4" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.5" osisID="1Cor.11.5" n="5" />while any woman, who prays or preaches in public bare-headed, dishonors him who is her head; for that is to make herself like one of the shameless women who shave their heads.
<verse eID="1Cor.11.5" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.6" osisID="1Cor.11.6" n="6" />Indeed, if a woman does not keep her head covered, she may as well cut her hair short. But, since to cut her hair short, or shave it off, marks her as one of the shameless women, she should keep her head covered.
<verse eID="1Cor.11.6" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.7" osisID="1Cor.11.7" n="7" />A man ought not to have his head covered, for he has been from the beginning the likeness of God and the reflection of his glory, but woman is the reflection of man’s glory.
<verse eID="1Cor.11.7" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.8" osisID="1Cor.11.8" n="8" />For it was not man who was taken from woman, but woman who was taken from man.
<verse eID="1Cor.11.8" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.9" osisID="1Cor.11.9" n="9" />Besides, man was not created for the sake of woman, but woman for the sake of man.
<verse eID="1Cor.11.9" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.10" osisID="1Cor.11.10" n="10" />And, therefore, a woman ought to wear on her head a symbol of her subjection, because of the presence of the angels.
<verse eID="1Cor.11.10" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.11" osisID="1Cor.11.11" n="11" />Still, when in union with the Lord, woman is not independent of man, or man of woman;
<verse eID="1Cor.11.11" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.12" osisID="1Cor.11.12" n="12" />for just as woman came from man, so man comes by means of woman; and all things come from God.
<verse eID="1Cor.11.12" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.13" osisID="1Cor.11.13" n="13" />Judge for yourselves. Is it fitting that a woman should pray to God in public with her head uncovered?
<verse eID="1Cor.11.13" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.14" osisID="1Cor.11.14" n="14" />Does not nature herself teach us that, while for a man to wear his hair long is degrading to him,
<verse eID="1Cor.11.14" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.15" osisID="1Cor.11.15" n="15" />a woman’s long hair is her glory? Her hair has been given her to serve as a covering.
<verse eID="1Cor.11.15" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.16" osisID="1Cor.11.16" n="16" />If, however, anyone still thinks it right to contest the point – well, we have no such custom, nor have the churches of God.
<verse eID="1Cor.11.16" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Cor.11.17" osisID="1Cor.11.17" n="17" />In giving directions on the next subject, I cannot praise you; because your meetings do more harm than good.
<verse eID="1Cor.11.17" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.18" osisID="1Cor.11.18" n="18" />To begin with, I am told that when you meet together as a church there are divisions among you. In part I believe this,
<verse eID="1Cor.11.18" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.19" osisID="1Cor.11.19" n="19" />indeed, there must be parties among you, so that the people of real worth become known.
<verse eID="1Cor.11.19" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.20" osisID="1Cor.11.20" n="20" />When you meet together, as I understand, it is not possible to eat the Lord’s Supper;
<verse eID="1Cor.11.20" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.21" osisID="1Cor.11.21" n="21" />for, as you eat, each of you tries to secure his own supper first, with the result that one has too little to eat, and another has too much to drink!
<verse eID="1Cor.11.21" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.22" osisID="1Cor.11.22" n="22" />Have you no houses in which you can eat and drink? Or are you trying to show your contempt for the church of God, and to humiliate the poor? What can I say to you? Should I praise you? In this matter I cannot praise you.
<verse eID="1Cor.11.22" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.23" osisID="1Cor.11.23" n="23" />For I myself received from the Lord the account which I have in turn given to you – how the Lord Jesus, on the very night of his betrayal, took some bread,
<verse eID="1Cor.11.23" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.24" osisID="1Cor.11.24" n="24" />and, after saying the thanksgiving, broke it and said <q who="Jesus" marker="">“This is my own body given on your behalf. Do this in memory of me.”</q>
<verse eID="1Cor.11.24" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.25" osisID="1Cor.11.25" n="25" />And in the same way with the cup, after supper, saying <q who="Jesus" marker="">“This cup is the new covenant made by my blood. Do this, whenever you drink it, in memory of me.”</q>
<verse eID="1Cor.11.25" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.26" osisID="1Cor.11.26" n="26" />For whenever you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death – until he comes.
<verse eID="1Cor.11.26" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.27" osisID="1Cor.11.27" n="27" />Therefore, whoever eats the bread, or drinks the Lord’s cup, in an irreverent spirit, will have to answer for an offense against the Lord’s body and blood.
<verse eID="1Cor.11.27" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.28" osisID="1Cor.11.28" n="28" />Let everyone look into their own heart, and only then eat of the bread and drink from the cup.
<verse eID="1Cor.11.28" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.29" osisID="1Cor.11.29" n="29" />For the person who eats and drinks brings a judgment on themselves by their eating and drinking, when they do not discern the body.
<verse eID="1Cor.11.29" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.30" osisID="1Cor.11.30" n="30" />That is why so many among you are weak and ill, and why some are sleeping.
<verse eID="1Cor.11.30" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.31" osisID="1Cor.11.31" n="31" />But, if we judged ourselves rightly, we should not be judged.
<verse eID="1Cor.11.31" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.32" osisID="1Cor.11.32" n="32" />Yet, in being judged by the Lord, we are undergoing discipline, so that we may not have judgment passed on us with the rest of the world.
<verse eID="1Cor.11.32" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.33" osisID="1Cor.11.33" n="33" />Therefore, my friends, when you meet together to eat the Supper, wait for one another.
<verse eID="1Cor.11.33" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.34" osisID="1Cor.11.34" n="34" />If anyone is hungry, they should eat at home, so that your meetings may not bring a judgment on you. The other details I will settle when I come.
<verse eID="1Cor.11.34" />
<chapter eID="1Cor.11" />

<p>
<chapter sID="1Cor.12" osisID="1Cor.12" n="12" />
<verse sID="1Cor.12.1" osisID="1Cor.12.1" n="1" />In the next place, friends, I do not want you to be ignorant about spiritual gifts.
<verse eID="1Cor.12.1" />
<verse sID="1Cor.12.2" osisID="1Cor.12.2" n="2" />You know that there was a time when you were Gentiles, going astray after idols that could not speak, just as you happened to be led.
<verse eID="1Cor.12.2" />
<verse sID="1Cor.12.3" osisID="1Cor.12.3" n="3" />Therefore I tell you plainly that no one who speaks under the influence of the Spirit of God says ‘JESUS IS ACCURSED,’ and that no one can say ‘JESUS IS LORD,’ except under the influence of the Holy Spirit.
<verse eID="1Cor.12.3" />
<verse sID="1Cor.12.4" osisID="1Cor.12.4" n="4" />Gifts differ, but the Spirit is the same;
<verse eID="1Cor.12.4" />
<verse sID="1Cor.12.5" osisID="1Cor.12.5" n="5" />ways of serving differ, yet the Master is the same;
<verse eID="1Cor.12.5" />
<verse sID="1Cor.12.6" osisID="1Cor.12.6" n="6" />results differ, yet the God who brings about every result is in every case the same.
<verse eID="1Cor.12.6" />
<verse sID="1Cor.12.7" osisID="1Cor.12.7" n="7" />To each of us there is given spiritual illumination for the general good.
<verse eID="1Cor.12.7" />
<verse sID="1Cor.12.8" osisID="1Cor.12.8" n="8" />To one is given the power to speak with wisdom through the Spirit; to another the power to speak with knowledge, due to the same Spirit;
<verse eID="1Cor.12.8" />
<verse sID="1Cor.12.9" osisID="1Cor.12.9" n="9" />to another faith by the same Spirit; to another power to cure diseases by the one Spirit; to another supernatural powers;
<verse eID="1Cor.12.9" />
<verse sID="1Cor.12.10" osisID="1Cor.12.10" n="10" />to another the gift of preaching; to another the gift of distinguishing between true and false inspiration; to another varieties of the gift of ‘tongues’; to another the power to interpret ‘tongues.’
<verse eID="1Cor.12.10" />
<verse sID="1Cor.12.11" osisID="1Cor.12.11" n="11" />All these result from one and the same Spirit, who distributes his gifts to each individually as he wills.
<verse eID="1Cor.12.11" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Cor.12.12" osisID="1Cor.12.12" n="12" />For just as the human body is one whole, and yet has many parts, and all its parts, many though they are, form but one body, so it is with the Christ;
<verse eID="1Cor.12.12" />
<verse sID="1Cor.12.13" osisID="1Cor.12.13" n="13" />for it was by one Spirit that we were all baptized to form one body, whether Jews or Greeks, slaves or free, and were all imbued with one Spirit.
<verse eID="1Cor.12.13" />
<verse sID="1Cor.12.14" osisID="1Cor.12.14" n="14" />The human body, I repeat, consists not of one part, but of many.
<verse eID="1Cor.12.14" />
<verse sID="1Cor.12.15" osisID="1Cor.12.15" n="15" />If the foot says ‘Since I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,’ it does not because of that cease to belong to the body.
<verse eID="1Cor.12.15" />
<verse sID="1Cor.12.16" osisID="1Cor.12.16" n="16" />Or if the ear says ‘Since I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,’ it does not because of that cease to belong to the body.
<verse eID="1Cor.12.16" />
<verse sID="1Cor.12.17" osisID="1Cor.12.17" n="17" />If all the body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If it were all hearing, where would the sense of smell be?
<verse eID="1Cor.12.17" />
<verse sID="1Cor.12.18" osisID="1Cor.12.18" n="18" />But in fact God has placed each individual part just where he thought fit in the body.
<verse eID="1Cor.12.18" />
<verse sID="1Cor.12.19" osisID="1Cor.12.19" n="19" />If, however, they all made up only one part, where would the body be?
<verse eID="1Cor.12.19" />
<verse sID="1Cor.12.20" osisID="1Cor.12.20" n="20" />But in fact, although it has many parts, there is only one body.
<verse eID="1Cor.12.20" />
<verse sID="1Cor.12.21" osisID="1Cor.12.21" n="21" />The eye cannot say to the hand ‘I do not need you,’ nor, again, the head to the feet ‘I do not need you.’
<verse eID="1Cor.12.21" />
<verse sID="1Cor.12.22" osisID="1Cor.12.22" n="22" />No! Those parts of the body that seem naturally the weaker are indispensable;
<verse eID="1Cor.12.22" />
<verse sID="1Cor.12.23" osisID="1Cor.12.23" n="23" />and those parts which we deem less honorable we surround with special honor; and our ungraceful parts receive a special grace which our graceful parts do not require.
<verse eID="1Cor.12.23" />
<verse sID="1Cor.12.24" osisID="1Cor.12.24" n="24" />Yes, God has so constructed the body – by giving a special honor to the part that lacks it –
<verse eID="1Cor.12.24" />
<verse sID="1Cor.12.25" osisID="1Cor.12.25" n="25" />As to secure that there should be no disunion in the body, but that the parts should show the same care for one another.
<verse eID="1Cor.12.25" />
<verse sID="1Cor.12.26" osisID="1Cor.12.26" n="26" />If one part suffers, all the others suffer with it, and if one part has honor done it, all the others share its joy.
<verse eID="1Cor.12.26" />
<verse sID="1Cor.12.27" osisID="1Cor.12.27" n="27" />Together you are the body of Christ, and individually its parts.
<verse eID="1Cor.12.27" />
<verse sID="1Cor.12.28" osisID="1Cor.12.28" n="28" />In the church God has appointed, first, apostles, secondly preachers, thirdly teachers; then he has given supernatural powers, then power to cure diseases, aptness for helping others, capacity to govern, varieties of the gift of ‘tongues.’
<verse eID="1Cor.12.28" />
<verse sID="1Cor.12.29" osisID="1Cor.12.29" n="29" />Can everyone be an apostle? Can everyone be a preacher? Can everyone be a teacher? Can everyone have supernatural powers?
<verse eID="1Cor.12.29" />
<verse sID="1Cor.12.30" osisID="1Cor.12.30" n="30" />Can everyone have power to cure diseases? Can everyone speak in ‘tongues’? Can everyone interpret them?
<verse eID="1Cor.12.30" />
<verse sID="1Cor.12.31" osisID="1Cor.12.31" n="31" />Strive for the greater gifts.

<p>
Yet I can still show you a way beyond all comparison the best.
<verse eID="1Cor.12.31" />
<chapter eID="1Cor.12" />
<chapter sID="1Cor.13" osisID="1Cor.13" n="13" />
<verse sID="1Cor.13.1" osisID="1Cor.13.1" n="1" />Though I speak in the ‘tongues’ of people, or even of angels, yet have not love, I have become mere echoing brass, or a clanging cymbal!
<verse eID="1Cor.13.1" />
<verse sID="1Cor.13.2" osisID="1Cor.13.2" n="2" />Even though I have the gift of preaching, and fathom all hidden truths and all the depths of knowledge; even though I have such faith as might move mountains, yet have not love, I am nothing!
<verse eID="1Cor.13.2" />
<verse sID="1Cor.13.3" osisID="1Cor.13.3" n="3" />Even though I dole my substance to the poor, even though I sacrifice my body in order to boast, yet have not love, it avails me nothing!
<verse eID="1Cor.13.3" />
<verse sID="1Cor.13.4" osisID="1Cor.13.4" n="4" />Love is long-suffering, and kind; love is never envious, never boastful, never conceited, never behaves unbecomingly;
<verse eID="1Cor.13.4" />
<verse sID="1Cor.13.5" osisID="1Cor.13.5" n="5" />love is never self-seeking, never provoked, never reckons up her wrongs;
<verse eID="1Cor.13.5" />
<verse sID="1Cor.13.6" osisID="1Cor.13.6" n="6" />love never rejoices at evil, but rejoices in the triumph of truth;
<verse eID="1Cor.13.6" />
<verse sID="1Cor.13.7" osisID="1Cor.13.7" n="7" />love bears with all things, ever trustful, ever hopeful, ever patient.
<verse eID="1Cor.13.7" />
<verse sID="1Cor.13.8" osisID="1Cor.13.8" n="8" />Love never fails. But, whether it be the gift of preaching, it will be done with; whether it be the gift of ‘tongues,’ it will cease; whether it be knowledge, it, too, will be done with.
<verse eID="1Cor.13.8" />
<verse sID="1Cor.13.9" osisID="1Cor.13.9" n="9" />For our knowledge is incomplete, and our preaching is incomplete,
<verse eID="1Cor.13.9" />
<verse sID="1Cor.13.10" osisID="1Cor.13.10" n="10" />but, when the perfect has come, that which is incomplete will be done with.
<verse eID="1Cor.13.10" />
<verse sID="1Cor.13.11" osisID="1Cor.13.11" n="11" />When I was a child, I talked as a child, I felt as a child, I reasoned as a child; now that I am a man, I have done with childish ways.
<verse eID="1Cor.13.11" />
<verse sID="1Cor.13.12" osisID="1Cor.13.12" n="12" />As yet we see, in a mirror, dimly, but then – face to face! As yet my knowledge is incomplete, but then I will know in full, as I have been fully known.
<verse eID="1Cor.13.12" />
<verse sID="1Cor.13.13" osisID="1Cor.13.13" n="13" />Meanwhile faith, hope, and love endure – these three, but the greatest of these is love.

<chapter sID="1Cor.14" osisID="1Cor.14" n="14" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.1" osisID="1Cor.14.1" n="1" />Seek this love earnestly, and strive for spiritual gifts, above all for the gift of preaching.
<verse eID="1Cor.14.1" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.2" osisID="1Cor.14.2" n="2" />The person who, when speaking, uses the gift of ‘tongues’ is speaking, not to people, but to God, for no one understands them; yet in spirit they are speaking of hidden truths.
<verse eID="1Cor.14.2" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.3" osisID="1Cor.14.3" n="3" />But those who preach are speaking to their fellow men and women words that will build up faith, and give them comfort and encouragement.
<verse eID="1Cor.14.3" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.4" osisID="1Cor.14.4" n="4" />Those who, when speaking, use the gift of ‘tongues’ builds up their own faith, while those who preach build up the faith of the church.
<verse eID="1Cor.14.4" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.5" osisID="1Cor.14.5" n="5" />Now I want you all to speak in ‘tongues,’ but much more I wish that you should preach. A preacher is worth more than one who speaks in ‘tongues,’ unless they interprets their words, so that the faith of the church may be built up.
<verse eID="1Cor.14.5" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.6" osisID="1Cor.14.6" n="6" />This being so, friends, what good will I do you, if I come to you and speak in ‘tongues,’ unless my words convey some revelation, or knowledge, or take the form of preaching or teaching?
<verse eID="1Cor.14.6" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.7" osisID="1Cor.14.7" n="7" />Even with inanimate things, such as a flute or a harp, though they produce sounds, yet unless the notes are quite distinct, how can the tune played on the flute or the harp be recognized?
<verse eID="1Cor.14.7" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.8" osisID="1Cor.14.8" n="8" />If the bugle sounds a doubtful call, who will prepare for battle?
<verse eID="1Cor.14.8" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.9" osisID="1Cor.14.9" n="9" />And so with you; unless, in using the gift of ‘tongues,’ you utter intelligible words, how can what you say be understood? You will be speaking to the winds!
<verse eID="1Cor.14.9" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.10" osisID="1Cor.14.10" n="10" />There is, for instance, a certain number of different languages in the world, and not one of them fails to convey meaning.
<verse eID="1Cor.14.10" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.11" osisID="1Cor.14.11" n="11" />If, however, I do not happen to know the language, I will be a foreigner to those who speak it, and they will be foreigners to me.
<verse eID="1Cor.14.11" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.12" osisID="1Cor.14.12" n="12" />And so with you; since your are striving for spiritual gifts, be eager to excel in such as will build up the faith of the church.
<verse eID="1Cor.14.12" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.13" osisID="1Cor.14.13" n="13" />Therefore anyone who, when speaking, uses the gift of ‘tongues’ should pray for ability to interpret them.
<verse eID="1Cor.14.13" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.14" osisID="1Cor.14.14" n="14" />If, when praying, I use the gift of ‘tongues,’ my spirit indeed prays, but my mind is a blank.
<verse eID="1Cor.14.14" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.15" osisID="1Cor.14.15" n="15" />What, then, is my conclusion? Simply this – I will pray with my spirit, but with my mind as well; I will sing with my spirit, but with my mind as well.
<verse eID="1Cor.14.15" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.16" osisID="1Cor.14.16" n="16" />If you bless God with your spirit only, how can people in the congregation who are without your gift say ‘Amen’ to your thanksgiving? They do not know what you are saying!
<verse eID="1Cor.14.16" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.17" osisID="1Cor.14.17" n="17" />Your thanksgiving may be excellent, but the other is not helped by it.
<verse eID="1Cor.14.17" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.18" osisID="1Cor.14.18" n="18" />Thank God, I use the gift of ‘tongues’ more than any of you.
<verse eID="1Cor.14.18" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.19" osisID="1Cor.14.19" n="19" />But at a meeting of the church I would rather speak five words with my mind, and so teach others, than ten thousand words when using the gift of ‘tongues.’
<verse eID="1Cor.14.19" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Cor.14.20" osisID="1Cor.14.20" n="20" />My friends, do not show yourselves children in understanding. In wickedness be infants, but in understanding show yourselves adults.
<verse eID="1Cor.14.20" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.21" osisID="1Cor.14.21" n="21" />It is said in the Law –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘In strange tongues and by the lips of strangers will I speak to this people, but even then they will not listen to me, says the Lord.’ <verse eID="1Cor.14.21" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="1Cor.14.22" osisID="1Cor.14.22" n="22" />Therefore the gift of the ‘tongues’ is intended as a sign, not for those who believe in Christ, but for those who do not, while the gift of preaching is intended as a sign, not for those who do not believe in Christ, but for those who do.
<verse eID="1Cor.14.22" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.23" osisID="1Cor.14.23" n="23" />So, when the whole church meets, if all present use the gift of ‘tongues,’ and some people who are without the gift, or who are unbelievers, come in, will not they say that you are mad?
<verse eID="1Cor.14.23" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.24" osisID="1Cor.14.24" n="24" />While, if all those present use the gift of preaching, and an unbeliever, or someone without the gift, comes in, they are convinced of their sinfulness by them all, they are called to account by them all;
<verse eID="1Cor.14.24" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.25" osisID="1Cor.14.25" n="25" />the secrets of their heart are revealed, and then, throwing themselves on their face, they will worship God, and declare ‘God is indeed among you!’
<verse eID="1Cor.14.25" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Cor.14.26" osisID="1Cor.14.26" n="26" />What do I suggest, then, friends? Whenever you meet for worship, each of you comes, either with a hymn, or a lesson, or a revelation, or the gift of ‘tongues,’ or the interpretation of them; let everything be directed to the building up of faith.
<verse eID="1Cor.14.26" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.27" osisID="1Cor.14.27" n="27" />If any of you use the gift of ‘tongues,’ not more than two, or at the most three, should do so – each speaking in his turn – and someone should interpret them.
<verse eID="1Cor.14.27" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.28" osisID="1Cor.14.28" n="28" />If there is no one able to interpret what is said, they should remain silent at the meeting of the church, and speak to themselves and to God.
<verse eID="1Cor.14.28" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.29" osisID="1Cor.14.29" n="29" />Of preachers two or three should speak, and the rest should weigh well what is said.
<verse eID="1Cor.14.29" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.30" osisID="1Cor.14.30" n="30" />But, if some revelation is made to another person as he sits there, the first speaker should stop.
<verse eID="1Cor.14.30" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.31" osisID="1Cor.14.31" n="31" />For you can all preach in turn, so that all may learn some lesson and all receive encouragement.
<verse eID="1Cor.14.31" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.32" osisID="1Cor.14.32" n="32" />(The spirit that moves the preachers is within the preachers’ control;
<verse eID="1Cor.14.32" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.33" osisID="1Cor.14.33" n="33" />for God is not a God of disorder, but of peace.) This custom prevails in all the churches of Christ’s people.
<verse eID="1Cor.14.33" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Cor.14.34" osisID="1Cor.14.34" n="34" />At the meetings of the church married women should remain silent, for they are not allowed to speak in public; they should take a subordinate place, as the Law itself directs.
<verse eID="1Cor.14.34" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.35" osisID="1Cor.14.35" n="35" />If they want information on any point, they should ask their husbands about it at home; for it is unbecoming for a married woman to speak at a meeting of the church.
<verse eID="1Cor.14.35" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.36" osisID="1Cor.14.36" n="36" />What! Did God’s message to the world originate with you? Or did it find its way to none but you?
<verse eID="1Cor.14.36" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Cor.14.37" osisID="1Cor.14.37" n="37" />If anyone thinks that he has the gift of preaching or any other spiritual gift, he should recognize that what I am now saying to you is a command from the Lord.
<verse eID="1Cor.14.37" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.38" osisID="1Cor.14.38" n="38" />Anyone who ignores it may be ignored.
<verse eID="1Cor.14.38" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.39" osisID="1Cor.14.39" n="39" />Therefore, my friends, strive for the gift of preaching, and yet do not forbid speaking in ‘tongues.’
<verse eID="1Cor.14.39" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.40" osisID="1Cor.14.40" n="40" />Let everything be done in a proper and orderly manner.

<!-- s --><title>The Apostle’s Teaching as to the Resurrection of the Dead</title>
<p>
<verse sID="1Cor.15.1" osisID="1Cor.15.1" n="1" />Next, friends, I would like to remind you of the good news which I told you, and which you received – the good news on which you have taken your stand,
<verse eID="1Cor.15.1" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.2" osisID="1Cor.15.2" n="2" />and by means of which you are being saved. I would like to remind you of the words that I used in telling it to you, since you are still holding fast to it, and since it was not in vain that you became believers in Christ.
<verse eID="1Cor.15.2" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.3" osisID="1Cor.15.3" n="3" />For at the very beginning of my teaching I gave you the account which I had myself received – that Christ died for our sins (as the scriptures had foretold),
<verse eID="1Cor.15.3" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.4" osisID="1Cor.15.4" n="4" />that he was buried, that on the third day he was raised (as the scriptures had foretold),
<verse eID="1Cor.15.4" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.5" osisID="1Cor.15.5" n="5" />and that he appeared to Cephas, and then to the Twelve.
<verse eID="1Cor.15.5" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.6" osisID="1Cor.15.6" n="6" />After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of his followers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have gone to their rest.
<verse eID="1Cor.15.6" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.7" osisID="1Cor.15.7" n="7" />After that, he appeared to James, and then to all the apostles.
<verse eID="1Cor.15.7" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.8" osisID="1Cor.15.8" n="8" />Last of all, he appeared even to me, who am, as it were, the abortion.
<verse eID="1Cor.15.8" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.9" osisID="1Cor.15.9" n="9" />For I am the meanest of the apostles, I who am unworthy of the name of ‘apostle,’ because I persecuted the church of God.
<verse eID="1Cor.15.9" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.10" osisID="1Cor.15.10" n="10" />But it is through the love of God that I am what I am, and the love that he showed me has not been wasted. No, I have toiled harder than any of them, and yet it was not I, but the love of God working with me.
<verse eID="1Cor.15.10" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.11" osisID="1Cor.15.11" n="11" />Whether, then, it was I or whether it was they, this we proclaim, and this you believed.
<verse eID="1Cor.15.11" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Cor.15.12" osisID="1Cor.15.12" n="12" />Now, if it is proclaimed of Christ that he has been raised from the dead, how is it that some of you say that there is no such thing as a resurrection of the dead?
<verse eID="1Cor.15.12" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.13" osisID="1Cor.15.13" n="13" />But, if there is no such thing as a resurrection of the dead, then even Christ has not been raised;
<verse eID="1Cor.15.13" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.14" osisID="1Cor.15.14" n="14" />and, if Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation is without meaning, and our faith without meaning also!
<verse eID="1Cor.15.14" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.15" osisID="1Cor.15.15" n="15" />Yes, and we are being proved to have borne false testimony about God; for we testified of God that he raised the Christ, whom he did not raise, if, indeed, the dead do not rise!
<verse eID="1Cor.15.15" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.16" osisID="1Cor.15.16" n="16" />For, if the dead do not rise, then even Christ himself has not been raised,
<verse eID="1Cor.15.16" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.17" osisID="1Cor.15.17" n="17" />and, if Christ has not been raised, your faith is folly – your sins are on you still!
<verse eID="1Cor.15.17" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.18" osisID="1Cor.15.18" n="18" />Yes, and they, who have passed to their rest in union with Christ, perished!
<verse eID="1Cor.15.18" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.19" osisID="1Cor.15.19" n="19" />If all that we have done has been to place our hope in Christ for this life, then we of all people are the most to be pitied.
<verse eID="1Cor.15.19" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Cor.15.20" osisID="1Cor.15.20" n="20" />But, in truth, Christ has been raised from the dead, the first-fruits of those who are at rest.
<verse eID="1Cor.15.20" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.21" osisID="1Cor.15.21" n="21" />For, since through a man there is death, so, too, through a man there is a resurrection of the dead.
<verse eID="1Cor.15.21" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.22" osisID="1Cor.15.22" n="22" />For, as through union with Adam all die, so through union with the Christ will all be made to live.
<verse eID="1Cor.15.22" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.23" osisID="1Cor.15.23" n="23" />But each in their proper order – Christ the first-fruits; afterward, at his coming, those who belong to the Christ.
<verse eID="1Cor.15.23" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.24" osisID="1Cor.15.24" n="24" />Then will come the end – when he surrenders the kingdom to his God and Father, having overthrown all other rule and all other authority and power.
<verse eID="1Cor.15.24" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.25" osisID="1Cor.15.25" n="25" />For he must reign until God ‘has put all his enemies under his feet.’
<verse eID="1Cor.15.25" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.26" osisID="1Cor.15.26" n="26" />The last enemy to be overthrown is death;
<verse eID="1Cor.15.26" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.27" osisID="1Cor.15.27" n="27" />for God has placed all things under Christ’s feet. (But, when it is said that all things have been placed under Christ, it is plain that God is excepted who placed everything under him.)
<verse eID="1Cor.15.27" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.28" osisID="1Cor.15.28" n="28" />And, when everything has been placed under him, the Son will place himself under God who placed everything under him, so that God may be all in all!
<verse eID="1Cor.15.28" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.29" osisID="1Cor.15.29" n="29" />Again, what good will they be doing who are baptized on behalf of the dead? If it is true that the dead do not rise, why are people baptized on their behalf?
<verse eID="1Cor.15.29" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.30" osisID="1Cor.15.30" n="30" />Why, too, do we risk our lives every hour?
<verse eID="1Cor.15.30" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.31" osisID="1Cor.15.31" n="31" />Daily I face death – I swear it, friends, by the pride in you that I feel through my union with Christ Jesus, our Lord.
<verse eID="1Cor.15.31" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.32" osisID="1Cor.15.32" n="32" />If with only human hopes I had fought in the arena at Ephesus, what should I have gained by it? If the dead do not rise, then let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we will die!

<verse eID="1Cor.15.39" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.40" osisID="1Cor.15.40" n="40" />There are heavenly bodies, and earthly bodies; but the beauty of the heavenly bodies is not the beauty of the earthly.
<verse eID="1Cor.15.40" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.41" osisID="1Cor.15.41" n="41" />There is a beauty of the sun, and a beauty of the moon, and a beauty of the stars; for even star differs from star in beauty.
<verse eID="1Cor.15.41" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.42" osisID="1Cor.15.42" n="42" />It is the same with the resurrection of the dead. Sown a mortal body, it rises immortal; sown disfigured, it rises beautiful;

<verse sID="1Cor.15.46" osisID="1Cor.15.46" n="46" />That which comes first is not the spiritual, but the human; afterward comes the spiritual;

<verse sID="1Cor.15.58" osisID="1Cor.15.58" n="58" />Therefore, my dear friends, stand firm, unshaken, always diligent in the Lord’s work, for you know that, in union with him, your toil is not in vain.

<!-- s --><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>
<verse sID="1Cor.16.1" osisID="1Cor.16.1" n="1" />With reference to the collection for Christ’s people, I want you to follow the instructions that I gave to the churches in Galatia.
<verse eID="1Cor.16.1" />
<verse sID="1Cor.16.2" osisID="1Cor.16.2" n="2" />On the first day of every week each of you should put by what he can afford, so that no collections need be made after I have come.
<verse eID="1Cor.16.2" />
<verse sID="1Cor.16.3" osisID="1Cor.16.3" n="3" />On my arrival, I will send any persons, whom you may authorize by letter, to carry your gift to Jerusalem;
<verse eID="1Cor.16.3" />
<verse sID="1Cor.16.4" osisID="1Cor.16.4" n="4" />and, if it appears to be worth while for me to go also, they will go with me.
<verse eID="1Cor.16.4" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Cor.16.5" osisID="1Cor.16.5" n="5" />I will come to you as soon as I have been through Macedonia – for I am going through Macedonia –
<verse eID="1Cor.16.5" />
<verse sID="1Cor.16.6" osisID="1Cor.16.6" n="6" />And I will probably make some stay with you or, perhaps, remain for the winter, so that you may yourselves send me on my way, wherever I may be going.
<verse eID="1Cor.16.6" />
<verse sID="1Cor.16.7" osisID="1Cor.16.7" n="7" />I do not propose to pay you a visit in passing now, for I hope to stay with you for some time, if the Lord permits.
<verse eID="1Cor.16.7" />
<verse sID="1Cor.16.8" osisID="1Cor.16.8" n="8" />I intend, however, staying at Ephesus until the Festival at the close of the Harvest;
<verse eID="1Cor.16.8" />
<verse sID="1Cor.16.9" osisID="1Cor.16.9" n="9" />for a great opening for active work has presented itself, and there are many opponents.
<verse eID="1Cor.16.9" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Cor.16.10" osisID="1Cor.16.10" n="10" />If Timothy comes, take care that he has no cause for feeling anxious while he is with you. He is doing the Master’s work no less than I am.
<verse eID="1Cor.16.10" />
<verse sID="1Cor.16.11" osisID="1Cor.16.11" n="11" />No one, therefore, should slight him. See him safely on his way to me, for I am expecting him with some of our friends.
<verse eID="1Cor.16.11" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Cor.16.12" osisID="1Cor.16.12" n="12" />As for our friend Apollos, I have often urged him to go to you with the others. He has, however, been very unwilling to do so as yet; but he will go as soon as he finds a good opportunity.
<verse eID="1Cor.16.12" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Cor.16.13" osisID="1Cor.16.13" n="13" />Be watchful; stand firm in your faith; be brave; be strong.
<verse eID="1Cor.16.13" />
<verse sID="1Cor.16.14" osisID="1Cor.16.14" n="14" />Let everything you do be done in a loving spirit.
<verse eID="1Cor.16.14" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Cor.16.15" osisID="1Cor.16.15" n="15" />I have another request to make of you, friends. You remember Stephanas and his household, and that they were the first-fruits gathered in from Greece, and set themselves to serve Christ’s people.
<verse eID="1Cor.16.15" />
<verse sID="1Cor.16.16" osisID="1Cor.16.16" n="16" />I want you, on your part, to show deference to such people as these, as well as to every fellow laborer and earnest worker.
<verse eID="1Cor.16.16" />
<verse sID="1Cor.16.17" osisID="1Cor.16.17" n="17" />I am glad Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus have come, for they have made up for your absence;
<verse eID="1Cor.16.17" />
<verse sID="1Cor.16.18" osisID="1Cor.16.18" n="18" />they have cheered my heart, and your hearts also. Recognize the worth of such people as these.
<verse eID="1Cor.16.18" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Cor.16.19" osisID="1Cor.16.19" n="19" />The churches in Roman Asia send you their greetings. Aquila and Prisca and the church that meets at their house send you many Christian greetings.
<verse eID="1Cor.16.19" />
<verse sID="1Cor.16.20" osisID="1Cor.16.20" n="20" />All of the Lord’s followers send you greetings. Greet one another with a sacred kiss.
<verse eID="1Cor.16.20" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Cor.16.21" osisID="1Cor.16.21" n="21" />I, Paul, add this greeting in my own handwriting.
<verse eID="1Cor.16.21" />
<verse sID="1Cor.16.22" osisID="1Cor.16.22" n="22" />Accursed be anyone who has no love for the Lord. THE LORD IS COMING.
<verse eID="1Cor.16.22" />
<verse sID="1Cor.16.23" osisID="1Cor.16.23" n="23" />May the blessing of the Lord Jesus be with you.
<verse eID="1Cor.16.23" />
<verse sID="1Cor.16.24" osisID="1Cor.16.24" n="24" />My love to all of you who are in union with Christ Jesus.

<!-- s --><title>Introduction</title>
<p>
<verse sID="2Cor.1.1" osisID="2Cor.1.1" n="1" />To the church of God in Corinth, and to all Christ’s people throughout Greece, from Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, by the will of God, and from Timothy, who is also a follower.
<verse eID="2Cor.1.1" />
<verse sID="2Cor.1.2" osisID="2Cor.1.2" n="2" />May God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace.
<verse eID="2Cor.1.2" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="2Cor.1.3" osisID="2Cor.1.3" n="3" />Blessed is the God and Father of Jesus Christ our Lord, the all-merciful Father, the God ever ready to console,
<verse eID="2Cor.1.3" />
<verse sID="2Cor.1.4" osisID="2Cor.1.4" n="4" />who consoles us in all our troubles, so that we may be able to console those who are in any trouble with the consolation that we ourselves receive from him.
<verse eID="2Cor.1.4" />
<verse sID="2Cor.1.5" osisID="2Cor.1.5" n="5" />It is true that we have our full share of the sufferings of the Christ, but through the Christ we have also our full share of consolation.
<verse eID="2Cor.1.5" />
<verse sID="2Cor.1.6" osisID="2Cor.1.6" n="6" />If we meet with trouble, it is for the sake of your consolation and salvation; and, if we find consolation, it is for the sake of the consolation that you will experience when you are called to endure the sufferings that we ourselves are enduring;
<verse eID="2Cor.1.6" />
<verse sID="2Cor.1.7" osisID="2Cor.1.7" n="7" />and our hope for you remains unshaken. We know that, as you are sharing our sufferings, you will also share our consolation.
<verse eID="2Cor.1.7" />
<verse sID="2Cor.1.8" osisID="2Cor.1.8" n="8" />We want you, friends, to know that, in the troubles which befell us in Roman Asia, we were burdened altogether beyond our strength, so much so that we even despaired of life.
<verse eID="2Cor.1.8" />
<verse sID="2Cor.1.9" osisID="2Cor.1.9" n="9" />Indeed, we had the presentiment that we must die, so that we might rely, not on ourselves, but on God who raises the dead.
<verse eID="2Cor.1.9" />
<verse sID="2Cor.1.10" osisID="2Cor.1.10" n="10" />And from so imminent a death God delivered us, and will deliver us again; for in him we have placed our hopes of future deliverance, while you, also, help us by your prayers.
<verse eID="2Cor.1.10" />
<verse sID="2Cor.1.11" osisID="2Cor.1.11" n="11" />And then many lips will give thanks on our behalf for the blessing granted us in answer to many prayers.

<!-- s --><title>The Apostle’s Relations with his Converts</title>
<p>
<verse sID="2Cor.1.12" osisID="2Cor.1.12" n="12" />Indeed, our main ground for satisfaction is this – Our conscience tells us that our conduct in the world, and still more in our relations with you, was marked by a purity of motive and a sincerity that were inspired by God, and was based, not on worldly policy, but on the help of God.
<verse eID="2Cor.1.12" />
<verse sID="2Cor.1.13" osisID="2Cor.1.13" n="13" />We never write anything to you other than what you will acknowledge to the very end –
<verse eID="2Cor.1.13" />
<verse sID="2Cor.1.14" osisID="2Cor.1.14" n="14" />And, indeed, you have already partly acknowledged it about us – that you have a right to be proud of us, as we will be proud of you, on the day of our Lord Jesus.
<verse eID="2Cor.1.14" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="2Cor.1.15" osisID="2Cor.1.15" n="15" />With this conviction in my mind, I planned to come to see you first, so that your pleasure might be doubled –
<verse eID="2Cor.1.15" />
<verse sID="2Cor.1.16" osisID="2Cor.1.16" n="16" />To visit you both on my way to Macedonia, and to come to you again on my return from Macedonia, and then to get you to send me on my way into Judea.
<verse eID="2Cor.1.16" />
<verse sID="2Cor.1.17" osisID="2Cor.1.17" n="17" />As this was my plan, where, pray, did I show any fickleness of purpose? Or do you think that my plans are formed on mere impulse, so that in the same breath I say ‘Yes’ and ‘No’?
<verse eID="2Cor.1.17" />
<verse sID="2Cor.1.18" osisID="2Cor.1.18" n="18" />As God is true, the message that we brought you does not waver between ‘Yes’ and ‘No’!
<verse eID="2Cor.1.18" />
<verse sID="2Cor.1.19" osisID="2Cor.1.19" n="19" />The Son of God, Christ Jesus, whom we – Silas, Timothy, and I – proclaimed among you, never wavered between ‘Yes’ and ‘No.’ With him it has always been ‘Yes.’
<verse eID="2Cor.1.19" />
<verse sID="2Cor.1.20" osisID="2Cor.1.20" n="20" />For, many as were the promises of God, in Christ is the ‘Yes’ that fulfills them. Therefore, through Christ again, let the ‘Amen’ rise, through us, to the glory of God.
<verse eID="2Cor.1.20" />
<verse sID="2Cor.1.21" osisID="2Cor.1.21" n="21" />God who brings us, with you, into close union with Christ, and who consecrated us,
<verse eID="2Cor.1.21" />
<verse sID="2Cor.1.22" osisID="2Cor.1.22" n="22" />also set his seal on us, and gave us his Spirit in our hearts as a pledge of future blessings.
<verse eID="2Cor.1.22" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="2Cor.1.23" osisID="2Cor.1.23" n="23" />But, as my life will answer for it, I call God to witness that it was to spare you that I deferred my visit to Corinth.
<verse eID="2Cor.1.23" />
<verse sID="2Cor.1.24" osisID="2Cor.1.24" n="24" />I do not mean that we are to dictate to you with regard to your faith; on the contrary, we work with you for your true happiness; indeed, it is through your faith that you are standing firm.
<verse eID="2Cor.1.24" />
<chapter eID="2Cor.1" />
<chapter sID="2Cor.2" osisID="2Cor.2" n="2" />
<verse sID="2Cor.2.1" osisID="2Cor.2.1" n="1" />For my own sake, as well, I decided not to pay you another painful visit.
<verse eID="2Cor.2.1" />
<verse sID="2Cor.2.2" osisID="2Cor.2.2" n="2" />If it is I who cause you pain, why, who is there to cheer me, except the person whom I am paining?
<verse eID="2Cor.2.2" />
<verse sID="2Cor.2.3" osisID="2Cor.2.3" n="3" />So I wrote as I did because I was afraid that if I had come, I should have been pained by those who ought to have made me glad; for I felt sure that it was true of you all that my joy was in every case yours also.
<verse eID="2Cor.2.3" />
<verse sID="2Cor.2.4" osisID="2Cor.2.4" n="4" />I wrote to you in sore trouble and distress of heart and with many tears, not to give you pain, but to let you see how intense a love I have for you.
<verse eID="2Cor.2.4" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="2Cor.2.5" osisID="2Cor.2.5" n="5" />Now whoever has caused the pain has not so much pained me, as he has, to some extent – not to be too severe – pained every one of you.
<verse eID="2Cor.2.5" />
<verse sID="2Cor.2.6" osisID="2Cor.2.6" n="6" />The man to whom I refer has been sufficiently punished by the penalty inflicted by the majority of you;
<verse eID="2Cor.2.6" />
<verse sID="2Cor.2.7" osisID="2Cor.2.7" n="7" />so that now you must take the opposite course, and forgive and encourage him, or else he may be overwhelmed by the intensity of his pain.
<verse eID="2Cor.2.7" />
<verse sID="2Cor.2.8" osisID="2Cor.2.8" n="8" />So I entreat you to assure him of your love.
<verse eID="2Cor.2.8" />
<verse sID="2Cor.2.9" osisID="2Cor.2.9" n="9" />I had this further object, also, in what I wrote – to find out whether you might be relied on to be obedient in everything.
<verse eID="2Cor.2.9" />
<verse sID="2Cor.2.10" osisID="2Cor.2.10" n="10" />Anyone you forgive, I forgive them, too. Indeed, for my part, whatever I have forgiven (if I have had to forgive anything), I have forgiven for your sakes, in the presence of Christ,
<verse eID="2Cor.2.10" />
<verse sID="2Cor.2.11" osisID="2Cor.2.11" n="11" />so as to prevent Satan from taking advantage of us; for we are not ignorant of his devices.
<verse eID="2Cor.2.11" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="2Cor.2.12" osisID="2Cor.2.12" n="12" />When I went to the district around Troas to tell the good news of the Christ, even though there was an opening for serving the Master,
<verse eID="2Cor.2.12" />
<verse sID="2Cor.2.13" osisID="2Cor.2.13" n="13" />I could get no peace of mind because I failed to find Titus, my friend; so I took leave of the people there, and went on to Macedonia.
<verse eID="2Cor.2.13" />
<verse sID="2Cor.2.14" osisID="2Cor.2.14" n="14" />All thanks to God, who, through our union with the Christ, leads us in one continual triumph, and uses us to spread the sweet perfume of the knowledge of him in every place.
<verse eID="2Cor.2.14" />
<verse sID="2Cor.2.15" osisID="2Cor.2.15" n="15" />For we are the fragrance of Christ ascending to God – both among those who are in the path of salvation and among those who are in the path to ruin.
<verse eID="2Cor.2.15" />
<verse sID="2Cor.2.16" osisID="2Cor.2.16" n="16" />To the latter we are a stench which arises from death and tells of death; to the former a fragrance which arises from life and tells of life. But who is equal to such a task?
<verse eID="2Cor.2.16" />
<verse sID="2Cor.2.17" osisID="2Cor.2.17" n="17" />Unlike many people, we are not in the habit of making profit out of God’s message; but in all sincerity, and bearing God’s commission, we speak before him in union with Christ.
<verse eID="2Cor.2.17" />
<chapter eID="2Cor.2" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="2Cor.3" osisID="2Cor.3" n="3" />
<verse sID="2Cor.3.1" osisID="2Cor.3.1" n="1" />Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or are we like some who need letters of commendation to you, or from you?
<verse eID="2Cor.3.1" />
<verse sID="2Cor.3.2" osisID="2Cor.3.2" n="2" />You yourselves are our letter – a letter written on our hearts, and one which everybody can read and understand.
<verse eID="2Cor.3.2" />
<verse sID="2Cor.3.3" osisID="2Cor.3.3" n="3" />All can see that you are a letter from Christ delivered by us, a letter written, not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone, but on tablets of human hearts.
</p>
<verse eID="2Cor.3.3" />
<!-- s --><title>The Ministry of the Apostles</title>
<p>
<verse sID="2Cor.3.4" osisID="2Cor.3.4" n="4" />This, then, is the confidence in regard to God that we have gained through the Christ.
<verse eID="2Cor.3.4" />
<verse sID="2Cor.3.5" osisID="2Cor.3.5" n="5" />I do not mean that we are fit to form any judgment by ourselves, as if on our own authority;
<verse eID="2Cor.3.5" />
<verse sID="2Cor.3.6" osisID="2Cor.3.6" n="6" />our fitness comes from God, who himself made us fit to be assistants of a new covenant, of which the substance is, not a written Law, but a Spirit. For the written Law means death, but the Spirit gives life.
<verse eID="2Cor.3.6" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="2Cor.3.7" osisID="2Cor.3.7" n="7" />If the system of religion which involved death, embodied in a written Law and engraved on stones, began amid such glory, that the Israelites were unable to gaze at the face of Moses because of its glory, though it was but a passing glory,
<verse eID="2Cor.3.7" />
<verse sID="2Cor.3.8" osisID="2Cor.3.8" n="8" />will not the religion that confers the Spirit have still greater glory?
<verse eID="2Cor.3.8" />
<verse sID="2Cor.3.9" osisID="2Cor.3.9" n="9" />For, if there was a glory in the religion that involved condemnation, far greater is the glory of the religion that confers righteousness!
<verse eID="2Cor.3.9" />
<verse sID="2Cor.3.10" osisID="2Cor.3.10" n="10" />Indeed, that which then had glory has lost its glory, because of the glory which surpasses it.
<verse eID="2Cor.3.10" />
<verse sID="2Cor.3.11" osisID="2Cor.3.11" n="11" />And, if that which was to pass away was attended with glory, far more will that which is to endure be surrounded with glory!
<verse eID="2Cor.3.11" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="2Cor.3.12" osisID="2Cor.3.12" n="12" />With such a hope as this, we speak with all plainness;
<verse eID="2Cor.3.12" />
<verse sID="2Cor.3.13" osisID="2Cor.3.13" n="13" />unlike Moses, who covered his face with a veil, to prevent the Israelites from gazing at the disappearance of what was passing away.
<verse eID="2Cor.3.13" />
<verse sID="2Cor.3.14" osisID="2Cor.3.14" n="14" />But their minds were slow to learn. Indeed, to this very day, at the public reading of the old covenant, the same veil remains; only for those who are in union with Christ does it pass away.
<verse eID="2Cor.3.14" />
<verse sID="2Cor.3.15" osisID="2Cor.3.15" n="15" />But, even to this day, whenever Moses is read, a veil lies on their hearts.
<verse eID="2Cor.3.15" />
<verse sID="2Cor.3.16" osisID="2Cor.3.16" n="16" />Yet, whenever someone turns to the Lord, the veil is removed.
<verse eID="2Cor.3.16" />
<verse sID="2Cor.3.17" osisID="2Cor.3.17" n="17" />And the Lord is the Spirit, and, where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.
<verse eID="2Cor.3.17" />
<verse sID="2Cor.3.18" osisID="2Cor.3.18" n="18" />And all of us, with faces from which the veil is lifted, seeing, as if reflected in a mirror, the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into his likeness, from glory to glory, as it is given by the Lord, the Spirit.
<verse eID="2Cor.3.18" />
<chapter eID="2Cor.3" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="2Cor.4" osisID="2Cor.4" n="4" />
<verse sID="2Cor.4.1" osisID="2Cor.4.1" n="1" />Therefore, since it is by God’s mercy that we are engaged in this ministry, we do not lose heart.
<verse eID="2Cor.4.1" />
<verse sID="2Cor.4.2" osisID="2Cor.4.2" n="2" />No, we have renounced the secrecy prompted by shame, refusing to adopt crafty ways, or to tamper with God’s message, and commending ourselves to everyone’s conscience, in the sight of God, by our exhibition of the truth.
<verse eID="2Cor.4.2" />
<verse sID="2Cor.4.3" osisID="2Cor.4.3" n="3" />And, even if the good news that we bring is veiled, it is veiled only in the case of those who are on the path to ruin –
<verse eID="2Cor.4.3" />
<verse sID="2Cor.4.4" osisID="2Cor.4.4" n="4" />people whose minds have been blinded by the God of this age, unbelievers as they are, so that the light from the good news of the glory of the Christ, who is the incarnation of God, should not shine for them.
<verse eID="2Cor.4.4" />
<verse sID="2Cor.4.5" osisID="2Cor.4.5" n="5" />(For it is not ourselves that we proclaim, but Christ Jesus, as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus’ sake.)
<verse eID="2Cor.4.5" />
<verse sID="2Cor.4.6" osisID="2Cor.4.6" n="6" />Indeed, the same God who said ‘Out of darkness light will shine,’ has shone in on our hearts, so that we should bring out into the light the knowledge of the glory of God, seen in the face of Christ.
<verse eID="2Cor.4.6" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="2Cor.4.7" osisID="2Cor.4.7" n="7" />This treasure we have in these earthen vessels, so that its all-prevailing power may be seen to come from God, and not to be our own.
<verse eID="2Cor.4.7" />
<verse sID="2Cor.4.8" osisID="2Cor.4.8" n="8" />Though hard pressed on every side, we are never hemmed in; though perplexed, never driven to despair;
<verse eID="2Cor.4.8" />
<verse sID="2Cor.4.9" osisID="2Cor.4.9" n="9" />though pursued, never abandoned; though struck down, never killed!
<verse eID="2Cor.4.9" />
<verse sID="2Cor.4.10" osisID="2Cor.4.10" n="10" />We always bear on our bodies the marks of the death that Jesus died, so that the life also of Jesus may be exhibited in our bodies.
<verse eID="2Cor.4.10" />
<verse sID="2Cor.4.11" osisID="2Cor.4.11" n="11" />Indeed, we who still live are continually being given over to death for Jesus’ sake, so that the life also of Jesus may be exhibited in our mortal nature.
<verse eID="2Cor.4.11" />
<verse sID="2Cor.4.12" osisID="2Cor.4.12" n="12" />And so, while death is at work within us, life is at work within you.
<verse eID="2Cor.4.12" />
<verse sID="2Cor.4.13" osisID="2Cor.4.13" n="13" />But, in the same spirit of faith as that expressed in the words – ‘I believed, and therefore I spoke,’ we, also believe, and therefore speak.
<verse eID="2Cor.4.13" />
<verse sID="2Cor.4.14" osisID="2Cor.4.14" n="14" />For we know that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with him, and will bring us, with you, into his presence.
<verse eID="2Cor.4.14" />
<verse sID="2Cor.4.15" osisID="2Cor.4.15" n="15" />For all this is for your sakes, so that the loving kindness of God, spreading from heart to heart, may cause yet more hearts to overflow with thanksgiving, to his glory.
<verse eID="2Cor.4.15" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="2Cor.4.16" osisID="2Cor.4.16" n="16" />Therefore, as I said, we do not lose heart. No, even though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day.
<verse eID="2Cor.4.16" />
<verse sID="2Cor.4.17" osisID="2Cor.4.17" n="17" />The light burden of our momentary trouble is preparing for us, in measure transcending thought, a weight of imperishable glory;
<verse eID="2Cor.4.17" />
<verse sID="2Cor.4.18" osisID="2Cor.4.18" n="18" />we, all the while, gazing not on what is seen, but on what is unseen; for what is seen is transient, but what is unseen is imperishable.
<verse eID="2Cor.4.18" />
<chapter eID="2Cor.4" />
<chapter sID="2Cor.5" osisID="2Cor.5" n="5" />
<verse sID="2Cor.5.1" osisID="2Cor.5.1" n="1" />For we know that if our tent – that earthly body which is now our home – is taken down, we have a house of God’s building, a home not made by hands, imperishable, in heaven.
<verse eID="2Cor.5.1" />
<verse sID="2Cor.5.2" osisID="2Cor.5.2" n="2" />Even while in our present body we sigh, longing to put over it our heavenly house,
<verse eID="2Cor.5.2" />
<verse sID="2Cor.5.3" osisID="2Cor.5.3" n="3" />sure that, when we have put it on, we will never be found discarnate.
<verse eID="2Cor.5.3" />
<verse sID="2Cor.5.4" osisID="2Cor.5.4" n="4" />For we who are in this tent sigh under our burden, unwilling to take it off, yet wishing to put our heavenly body over it, so that all that is mortal may be absorbed in life.
<verse eID="2Cor.5.4" />
<verse sID="2Cor.5.5" osisID="2Cor.5.5" n="5" />And he who has prepared us for this change is God, who has also given us his Spirit as a pledge.
<verse eID="2Cor.5.5" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="2Cor.5.6" osisID="2Cor.5.6" n="6" />Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, while our home is in the body, we are absent from our home with the Lord.
<verse eID="2Cor.5.6" />
<verse sID="2Cor.5.7" osisID="2Cor.5.7" n="7" />For we guide our lives by faith, and not by what we see.
<verse eID="2Cor.5.7" />
<verse sID="2Cor.5.8" osisID="2Cor.5.8" n="8" />And in this confidence we would gladly leave our home in the body, and make our home with the Lord.
<verse eID="2Cor.5.8" />
<verse sID="2Cor.5.9" osisID="2Cor.5.9" n="9" />Therefore, whether in our home or absent from our home, our one ambition is to please him.
<verse eID="2Cor.5.9" />
<verse sID="2Cor.5.10" osisID="2Cor.5.10" n="10" />For at the court of the Christ we must all appear in our true characters, so that each may reap the results of the life which he has lived in the body, in accordance with his actions – whether good or worthless.
<verse eID="2Cor.5.10" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="2Cor.5.11" osisID="2Cor.5.11" n="11" />Therefore, because we know the fear inspired by the Lord, it is true that we are trying to win people over, but our motives are plain to God; and I hope that in your inmost hearts they are plain to you also.
<verse eID="2Cor.5.11" />
<verse sID="2Cor.5.12" osisID="2Cor.5.12" n="12" />We are not “commending ourselves” again to you, but rather are giving you cause for pride in us, so that you may have an answer ready for those who pride themselves on appearances and not on character.
<verse eID="2Cor.5.12" />
<verse sID="2Cor.5.13" osisID="2Cor.5.13" n="13" />For, if we were “beside ourselves,” it was in God’s service! If we are not in our senses, it is in yours!
<verse eID="2Cor.5.13" />
<verse sID="2Cor.5.14" osisID="2Cor.5.14" n="14" />It is the love of the Christ which compels us, when we reflect that, as one died for all, therefore all died;
<verse eID="2Cor.5.14" />
<verse sID="2Cor.5.15" osisID="2Cor.5.15" n="15" />and that he died for all, so that the living should no longer live for themselves, but for him who died and rose for them.
<verse eID="2Cor.5.15" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="2Cor.5.16" osisID="2Cor.5.16" n="16" />For ourselves, then, from this time forward, we refuse to regard anyone from the world’s standpoint. Even if we once thought of Christ from the standpoint of the world, yet now we do so no longer.
<verse eID="2Cor.5.16" />
<verse sID="2Cor.5.17" osisID="2Cor.5.17" n="17" />Therefore, if anyone is in union with Christ, he is a new being! His old life has passed away; a new life has begun!
<verse eID="2Cor.5.17" />
<verse sID="2Cor.5.18" osisID="2Cor.5.18" n="18" />But all this is the work of God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and gave us the Ministry of Reconciliation –
<verse eID="2Cor.5.18" />
<verse sID="2Cor.5.19" osisID="2Cor.5.19" n="19" />To proclaim that God, in Christ, was reconciling the world to himself, not reckoning people’s offenses against them, and that he had entrusted us with the message of this reconciliation.
<verse eID="2Cor.5.19" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="2Cor.5.20" osisID="2Cor.5.20" n="20" />It is, then, on Christ’s behalf that we are acting as ambassadors, God, as it were, appealing to you through us. We implore you on Christ’s behalf – Be reconciled to God.
<verse eID="2Cor.5.20" />
<verse sID="2Cor.5.21" osisID="2Cor.5.21" n="21" />For our sake God made Christ, who was innocent of sin, one with our sinfulness, so that in him we might be made one with the righteousness of God.
<verse eID="2Cor.5.21" />
<chapter eID="2Cor.5" />
<chapter sID="2Cor.6" osisID="2Cor.6" n="6" />
<verse sID="2Cor.6.1" osisID="2Cor.6.1" n="1" />Therefore, as God’s fellow workers, we also appeal to you not to receive his loving kindness in vain.
<verse eID="2Cor.6.1" />
<verse sID="2Cor.6.2" osisID="2Cor.6.2" n="2" />For he says –

<l level="1">and on the day of deliverance I helped you.’</l>

Now is the time for acceptance! Now is the day of deliverance!
<verse eID="2Cor.6.2" />
<verse sID="2Cor.6.3" osisID="2Cor.6.3" n="3" />Never do we put an obstacle in anyone’s way, so that no fault may be found with our ministry.
<verse eID="2Cor.6.3" />
<verse sID="2Cor.6.4" osisID="2Cor.6.4" n="4" />No, we are trying to commend ourselves under all circumstances, as God’s assistants should – in many an hour of endurance, in troubles, in hardships, in difficulties,
<verse eID="2Cor.6.4" />
<verse sID="2Cor.6.5" osisID="2Cor.6.5" n="5" />in floggings, in imprisonments, in riots, in toils, in sleepless nights, in fastings;
<verse eID="2Cor.6.5" />
<verse sID="2Cor.6.6" osisID="2Cor.6.6" n="6" />by purity, by knowledge, by patience, by kindliness, by holiness of spirit, by unfeigned love;
<verse eID="2Cor.6.6" />
<verse sID="2Cor.6.7" osisID="2Cor.6.7" n="7" />by the message of truth, and by the power of God; by the weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left;
<verse eID="2Cor.6.7" />
<verse sID="2Cor.6.8" osisID="2Cor.6.8" n="8" />amid honor and disrepute, amid slander and praise; regarded as deceivers, yet proved to be true;
<verse eID="2Cor.6.8" />
<verse sID="2Cor.6.9" osisID="2Cor.6.9" n="9" />as unknown, yet well-known; as at death’s door, yet, see, we are living; as chastised, yet not killed;
<verse eID="2Cor.6.9" />
<verse sID="2Cor.6.10" osisID="2Cor.6.10" n="10" />as saddened, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet enriching many; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things!

<p>
<verse sID="2Cor.6.14" osisID="2Cor.6.14" n="14" />Do not enter into inconsistent relations with those who reject the faith. For what partnership can there be between righteousness and lawlessness? Or what has light to do with darkness?
<verse eID="2Cor.6.14" />
<verse sID="2Cor.6.15" osisID="2Cor.6.15" n="15" />What harmony can there be between Christ and Belial? Or what can those who accept the faith have in common with those who reject it?

<verse sID="2Cor.6.16" osisID="2Cor.6.16" n="16" />What agreement can you be between a temple of God and idols? And we are a temple of the living God. That is what God meant when he said –

<verse eID="2Cor.7.1" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="2Cor.7.2" osisID="2Cor.7.2" n="2" />Make room for us in your hearts. In no instance have we ever wronged, or harmed, or taken advantage of, anyone.
<verse eID="2Cor.7.2" />
<verse sID="2Cor.7.3" osisID="2Cor.7.3" n="3" />I am not saying this to condemn you. Indeed, I have already said that you are in our heart, to live and die together.
<verse eID="2Cor.7.3" />
<verse sID="2Cor.7.4" osisID="2Cor.7.4" n="4" />I have the utmost confidence in you; I am always boasting about you. I am full of encouragement and, in spite of all our troubles, my heart is overflowing with happiness.
<verse eID="2Cor.7.4" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="2Cor.7.5" osisID="2Cor.7.5" n="5" />Ever since we reached Macedonia, we have had no rest in body or mind; on every side there have been troubles – conflicts without, anxieties within.
<verse eID="2Cor.7.5" />
<verse sID="2Cor.7.6" osisID="2Cor.7.6" n="6" />But God, who encourages the downcast, has encouraged us by the arrival of Titus.
<verse eID="2Cor.7.6" />
<verse sID="2Cor.7.7" osisID="2Cor.7.7" n="7" />And it is not only by his arrival that we are encouraged, but also by the encouragement which he received from you; for he tells us of your strong affection, your penitence, and your zeal on my behalf – so that I am happier still.
<verse eID="2Cor.7.7" />
<verse sID="2Cor.7.8" osisID="2Cor.7.8" n="8" />For, though I caused you sorrow by my letter, I do not regret it. Even if I were inclined to regret it – for I see that my letter did cause you sorrow though only for a time –
<verse eID="2Cor.7.8" />
<verse sID="2Cor.7.9" osisID="2Cor.7.9" n="9" />I am glad now; not because of the sorrow it caused you, but because your sorrow brought you to repentance. For it was God’s will that you should feel sorrow, in order that you should not suffer loss in any way at our hands.
<verse eID="2Cor.7.9" />
<verse sID="2Cor.7.10" osisID="2Cor.7.10" n="10" />For, when sorrow is in accordance with God’s will, it results in a repentance leading to salvation, and which will never be regretted. The sure result of the sorrow that the world knows is death.
<verse eID="2Cor.7.10" />
<verse sID="2Cor.7.11" osisID="2Cor.7.11" n="11" />For see what results that other sorrow – sorrow in accordance with God’s will – has had in your case. What earnestness it produced! What explanations! What strong feeling! What alarm! What longing! What eagerness! What readiness to punish! You have proved yourselves altogether free from guilt in that matter.
<verse eID="2Cor.7.11" />
<verse sID="2Cor.7.12" osisID="2Cor.7.12" n="12" />So, then, even though I did write to you, it was not for the sake of the wrong-doer, or of the man who was wronged, but to make you conscious, in the sight of God, of your own earnest care for us. And it is this that has encouraged us.
<verse eID="2Cor.7.12" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="2Cor.7.13" osisID="2Cor.7.13" n="13" />In addition to the encouragement that this gave us, we were made far happier still by the happiness of Titus for his heart has been cheered by you all.
<verse eID="2Cor.7.13" />
<verse sID="2Cor.7.14" osisID="2Cor.7.14" n="14" />Although I have been boasting a little to him about you, you did not put me to shame; but, just as every thing we had said to you was true, so our boasting to Titus about you has also proved to be the truth.
<verse eID="2Cor.7.14" />
<verse sID="2Cor.7.15" osisID="2Cor.7.15" n="15" />And his affection for you is all the greater, as he remembers the deference that you all showed him, and recalls how you received him with anxious care.

<verse sID="2Cor.8.1" osisID="2Cor.8.1" n="1" />We want to remind you, friends, of the love that God has shown to the churches in Macedonia –
<verse eID="2Cor.8.1" />
<verse sID="2Cor.8.2" osisID="2Cor.8.2" n="2" />How, tired though they were by many a trouble, their overflowing happiness, and even their deep poverty, resulted in a flood of generosity.
<verse eID="2Cor.8.2" />
<verse sID="2Cor.8.3" osisID="2Cor.8.3" n="3" />I can bear witness that to the full extent of their power, and even beyond their power, spontaneously,
<verse eID="2Cor.8.3" />
<verse sID="2Cor.8.4" osisID="2Cor.8.4" n="4" />and with many an appeal to us for permission, they showed their love, and contributed their share towards the fund for their fellow Christians.
<verse eID="2Cor.8.4" />
<verse sID="2Cor.8.5" osisID="2Cor.8.5" n="5" />And that, not only in the way we had expected; but first they gave themselves to the Lord, and to us also, in accordance with God’s will.
<verse eID="2Cor.8.5" />
<verse sID="2Cor.8.6" osisID="2Cor.8.6" n="6" />And this led us beg Titus, since he had started the work for you, he should also see to the completion of this expression of your love.
<verse eID="2Cor.8.6" />
<verse sID="2Cor.8.7" osisID="2Cor.8.7" n="7" />And, remembering how you excel in everything – in faith, in teaching, in knowledge, in unfailing earnestness, and in the affection that we have awakened in you – I ask you to excel also in this expression of your love.
<verse eID="2Cor.8.7" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="2Cor.8.8" osisID="2Cor.8.8" n="8" />I am not laying a command on you, but I am making use of the earnestness shown by others to test the genuineness of your affection.
<verse eID="2Cor.8.8" />
<verse sID="2Cor.8.9" osisID="2Cor.8.9" n="9" />For you do not forget the loving kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ – how that for your sakes, although he was rich, he became poor, so that you also might become rich through his poverty.
<verse eID="2Cor.8.9" />
<verse sID="2Cor.8.10" osisID="2Cor.8.10" n="10" />I am only making suggestions on this matter; for this is the best course for you, since you were a year before others, not only in taking action, but also in showing your readiness to do so.
<verse eID="2Cor.8.10" />
<verse sID="2Cor.8.11" osisID="2Cor.8.11" n="11" />And now I want you to complete the work, so that its completion may correspond with your willing readiness – in proportion, of course, to your means.
<verse eID="2Cor.8.11" />
<verse sID="2Cor.8.12" osisID="2Cor.8.12" n="12" />For, where there is willingness, a person’s gift is valued by its comparison with what they have, and not with what they do not have.
<verse eID="2Cor.8.12" />
<verse sID="2Cor.8.13" osisID="2Cor.8.13" n="13" />For our object is not to give relief to others and bring distress on you. It is a matter of a fair balance.
<verse eID="2Cor.8.13" />
<verse sID="2Cor.8.14" osisID="2Cor.8.14" n="14" />On this occasion what you can spare will supply what they need, at another time what they can spare may supply your need, and so things will be equal.

<verse sID="2Cor.8.23" osisID="2Cor.8.23" n="23" />If I must say anything about Titus, he is my intimate companion, and he shares my work for you; if it is our friends, they are delegates of the churches, an honor to Christ.

<verse sID="2Cor.8.24" osisID="2Cor.8.24" n="24" />Show them, therefore – so that the churches may see it – the proof of your affection, and the ground for our boasting to them about you.

<chapter sID="2Cor.9" osisID="2Cor.9" n="9" />
<verse sID="2Cor.9.1" osisID="2Cor.9.1" n="1" />With reference, indeed, to the Fund for your fellow Christians, it is quite superfluous for me to say anything to you.
<verse eID="2Cor.9.1" />
<verse sID="2Cor.9.2" osisID="2Cor.9.2" n="2" />I know, of course, your willingness to help, and I am always boasting of it to the Macedonians. I tell them that you in Greece have been ready for a year past; and it was really your zeal that stimulated most of them.
<verse eID="2Cor.9.2" />
<verse sID="2Cor.9.3" osisID="2Cor.9.3" n="3" />So my reason for sending our friends is to prevent what we said about you from proving, in this particular matter, an empty boast, and to enable you to be as well prepared as I have been saying that you are.
<verse eID="2Cor.9.3" />
<verse sID="2Cor.9.4" osisID="2Cor.9.4" n="4" />Otherwise, if any Macedonians were to come with me, and find you unprepared, we – to say nothing of you – should feel ashamed of our present confidence.
<verse eID="2Cor.9.4" />
<verse sID="2Cor.9.5" osisID="2Cor.9.5" n="5" />Therefore I think it necessary to beg the friends to go to you in advance, and to complete the arrangements for the gift, which you have already promised, so that it may be ready, as a gift, before I come, and not look as if it were being given under pressure.
<verse eID="2Cor.9.5" />

<verse sID="2Cor.9.12" osisID="2Cor.9.12" n="12" />For the rendering of a public service such as this, not only relieves the needs of your fellow Christians, but also results in the offering to God of many a thanksgiving.
<verse eID="2Cor.9.12" />
<verse sID="2Cor.9.13" osisID="2Cor.9.13" n="13" />Through the evidence afforded by the service rendered, you cause people to praise God for your fidelity to your profession of faith in the good news of the Christ, as well as for the liberality of your contributions for them and for all others.
<verse eID="2Cor.9.13" />
<verse sID="2Cor.9.14" osisID="2Cor.9.14" n="14" />And they also, in their prayers for you, express their longing to see you, because of the surpassing love of God displayed toward you.
<verse eID="2Cor.9.14" />
<verse sID="2Cor.9.15" osisID="2Cor.9.15" n="15" />All thanks to God for his inestimable gift!

<!-- s --><title>The Apostle’s Claims and Authority</title>
<p>
<verse sID="2Cor.10.1" osisID="2Cor.10.1" n="1" />Now, I, Paul, make a personal appeal to you by the meekness and gentleness of the Christ – I who, “in your presence, am humble in my bearing towards you, but, when absent, am bold in my language to you” –
<verse eID="2Cor.10.1" />
<verse sID="2Cor.10.2" osisID="2Cor.10.2" n="2" />I implore you not to drive me to “show my boldness,” when I do come, by the confident tone which I expect to have to adopt towards some of you, who are expecting to find us influenced in our conduct by earthly motives.
<verse eID="2Cor.10.2" />
<verse sID="2Cor.10.3" osisID="2Cor.10.3" n="3" />For, though we live an earthly life, we do not wage an earthly war.
<verse eID="2Cor.10.3" />
<verse sID="2Cor.10.4" osisID="2Cor.10.4" n="4" />The weapons for our warfare are not earthly, but, under God, are powerful enough to pull down strongholds.
<verse eID="2Cor.10.4" />
<verse sID="2Cor.10.5" osisID="2Cor.10.5" n="5" />We are engaged in confuting arguments and pulling down every barrier raised against the knowledge of God. We are taking captive every hostile thought, to bring it into submission to the Christ,
<verse eID="2Cor.10.5" />
<verse sID="2Cor.10.6" osisID="2Cor.10.6" n="6" />and are fully prepared to punish every act of rebellion, when once your submission is complete.
<verse eID="2Cor.10.6" />
<verse sID="2Cor.10.7" osisID="2Cor.10.7" n="7" />You look at the outward appearance of things! Let anyone, who is confident that he belongs to Christ, reflect, for himself, again on the fact – that we belong to Christ no less than he does.
<verse eID="2Cor.10.7" />
<verse sID="2Cor.10.8" osisID="2Cor.10.8" n="8" />Even if I boast extravagantly about our authority – which the Lord gave us for building up your faith and not for overthrowing it – still I have no reason to be ashamed.
<verse eID="2Cor.10.8" />
<verse sID="2Cor.10.9" osisID="2Cor.10.9" n="9" />I say this so that it doesn’t seem as if I am trying to overawe you by my letters.
<verse eID="2Cor.10.9" />
<verse sID="2Cor.10.10" osisID="2Cor.10.10" n="10" />For people say “His letters are impressive and vigorous, but his personal appearance is insignificant and his speaking contemptible.”
<verse eID="2Cor.10.10" />
<verse sID="2Cor.10.11" osisID="2Cor.10.11" n="11" />Let such a person be assured of this – that our words in our letters show us to be, when absent, just what our deeds will show us to be, when present.
<verse eID="2Cor.10.11" />
<verse sID="2Cor.10.12" osisID="2Cor.10.12" n="12" />We have not indeed the audacity to class or compare ourselves with some of those who indulge in self-commendation! But, when such persons measure themselves by themselves, and compare themselves with themselves, they show a want of wisdom.
<verse eID="2Cor.10.12" />
<verse sID="2Cor.10.13" osisID="2Cor.10.13" n="13" />We, however, will not give way to unlimited boasting, but will confine ourselves to the limits of the sphere to which God limited us, when he permitted us to come as far as Corinth.
<verse eID="2Cor.10.13" />
<verse sID="2Cor.10.14" osisID="2Cor.10.14" n="14" />For it is not the case, as it would be if we were not in the habit of coming to you, that we are exceeding our bounds! Why, we were the very first to reach you with the good news of the Christ!
<verse eID="2Cor.10.14" />
<verse sID="2Cor.10.15" osisID="2Cor.10.15" n="15" />Our boasting, therefore, is not unlimited, nor does it extend to the labors of others; but our hope is that, as your faith grows, our influence among you may be very greatly increased – though still confined to our sphere –
<verse eID="2Cor.10.15" />
<verse sID="2Cor.10.16" osisID="2Cor.10.16" n="16" />So that we will be able to tell the good news in the districts beyond you, without trespassing on the sphere assigned to others, or boasting of what has been already done.
<verse eID="2Cor.10.16" />
<verse sID="2Cor.10.17" osisID="2Cor.10.17" n="17" />Let anyone who boasts make their boast of the Lord.
<verse eID="2Cor.10.17" />
<verse sID="2Cor.10.18" osisID="2Cor.10.18" n="18" />For it is not those who commend themselves that stand the test, but those who are commended by the Lord.
<verse eID="2Cor.10.18" />
<chapter eID="2Cor.10" />

<p>
<chapter sID="2Cor.11" osisID="2Cor.11" n="11" />
<verse sID="2Cor.11.1" osisID="2Cor.11.1" n="1" />I could wish that you would tolerate a little folly in me! But indeed you do tolerate me.
<verse eID="2Cor.11.1" />
<verse sID="2Cor.11.2" osisID="2Cor.11.2" n="2" />I am jealous over you with the jealousy of God. For I engaged you to one husband so that I might present you to the Christ a pure bride.
<verse eID="2Cor.11.2" />
<verse sID="2Cor.11.3" osisID="2Cor.11.3" n="3" />Yet I fear that it may turn out that, just as the snake by his craftiness deceived Eve, so your minds may have lost the loyalty and purity due from you to the Christ.
<verse eID="2Cor.11.3" />
<verse sID="2Cor.11.4" osisID="2Cor.11.4" n="4" />For, if some newcomer is proclaiming a Jesus other than him whom we proclaimed, or if you are receiving a Spirit different from the Spirit which you received, or a good news different from that which you welcomed, then you are marvelously tolerant!
<verse eID="2Cor.11.4" />
<verse sID="2Cor.11.5" osisID="2Cor.11.5" n="5" />I do not regard myself as in any way inferior to the most eminent apostles!
<verse eID="2Cor.11.5" />
<verse sID="2Cor.11.6" osisID="2Cor.11.6" n="6" />Though I am no trained orator, yet I am not without knowledge; indeed we made this perfectly clear to you in every way.
<verse eID="2Cor.11.6" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="2Cor.11.7" osisID="2Cor.11.7" n="7" />Perhaps you say that I did wrong in humbling myself that you might be exalted – I mean because I told you God’s good news without payment.
<verse eID="2Cor.11.7" />
<verse sID="2Cor.11.8" osisID="2Cor.11.8" n="8" />I robbed other churches by taking pay from them, so that I might serve you!
<verse eID="2Cor.11.8" />
<verse sID="2Cor.11.9" osisID="2Cor.11.9" n="9" />And, when I was with you in need, I did not become a burden to any of you; for our friends, on coming from Macedonia, supplied my needs. I kept myself, and will keep myself from being an expense to you in any way.
<verse eID="2Cor.11.9" />
<verse sID="2Cor.11.10" osisID="2Cor.11.10" n="10" />As surely as I know anything of the truth of Christ, this boast, as far as I am concerned, will not be stopped in any part of Greece.
<verse eID="2Cor.11.10" />
<verse sID="2Cor.11.11" osisID="2Cor.11.11" n="11" />Why? Because I do not love you? God knows that I do!
<verse eID="2Cor.11.11" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="2Cor.11.12" osisID="2Cor.11.12" n="12" />What I am doing now I will continue to do in order to cut away the ground from under those who are wishing for some ground for attacking me, so that as regards the thing of which they boast they may appear in their true characters, just as we do.
<verse eID="2Cor.11.12" />
<verse sID="2Cor.11.13" osisID="2Cor.11.13" n="13" />Such people are false apostles, treacherous workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ!
<verse eID="2Cor.11.13" />
<verse sID="2Cor.11.14" osisID="2Cor.11.14" n="14" />And no wonder; for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.
<verse eID="2Cor.11.14" />
<verse sID="2Cor.11.15" osisID="2Cor.11.15" n="15" />It is not surprising, therefore, if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. But their end will be in accordance with their actions.
<verse eID="2Cor.11.15" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="2Cor.11.16" osisID="2Cor.11.16" n="16" />I say again – Let no one think me a fool! Yet, if you do, at least welcome me as you would a fool, so that I, too may indulge in a little boasting.
<verse eID="2Cor.11.16" />
<verse sID="2Cor.11.17" osisID="2Cor.11.17" n="17" />When I speak like this, I am not speaking as the Master would, but as a fool might, in boasting so confidently.
<verse eID="2Cor.11.17" />
<verse sID="2Cor.11.18" osisID="2Cor.11.18" n="18" />As so many are boasting of earthly things, I, too, will boast.
<verse eID="2Cor.11.18" />
<verse sID="2Cor.11.19" osisID="2Cor.11.19" n="19" />For all your cleverness, you tolerate fools willingly enough!
<verse eID="2Cor.11.19" />
<verse sID="2Cor.11.20" osisID="2Cor.11.20" n="20" />You tolerate a person even when they enslave you, when they plunder you, when they get you into their power, when they put on airs of superiority, when they strike you in the face!
<verse eID="2Cor.11.20" />
<verse sID="2Cor.11.21" osisID="2Cor.11.21" n="21" />I admit, to my shame, that we have been weak. But whatever the subject on which others are not afraid to boast – though it is foolish to say so – I am not afraid either!
<verse eID="2Cor.11.21" />
<verse sID="2Cor.11.22" osisID="2Cor.11.22" n="22" />Are they Hebrews? So am I! Are they Israelites? So am I! Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I!
<verse eID="2Cor.11.22" />
<verse sID="2Cor.11.23" osisID="2Cor.11.23" n="23" />Are they ‘Servants of Christ’? Though it is madness to talk like this, I am more so than they! I have had more of toil, more of imprisonment! I have been flogged times without number. I have been often at death’s door.
<verse eID="2Cor.11.23" />
<verse sID="2Cor.11.24" osisID="2Cor.11.24" n="24" />Five times I received at the hands of my own people forty lashes, all but one.
<verse eID="2Cor.11.24" />
<verse sID="2Cor.11.25" osisID="2Cor.11.25" n="25" />Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I was stoned. Three times I was shipwrecked. I have spent a whole day and night in the deep.
<verse eID="2Cor.11.25" />
<verse sID="2Cor.11.26" osisID="2Cor.11.26" n="26" />My journeys have been many. I have been through dangers from rivers, dangers from robbers, dangers from my own people, dangers from the Gentiles, dangers in towns, dangers in the country, dangers on the sea, dangers among people pretending to be followers of the Lord.
<verse eID="2Cor.11.26" />
<verse sID="2Cor.11.27" osisID="2Cor.11.27" n="27" />I have been through toil and hardship. I have passed many a sleepless night; I have endured hunger and thirst; I have often been without food; I have known cold and nakedness.
<verse eID="2Cor.11.27" />
<verse sID="2Cor.11.28" osisID="2Cor.11.28" n="28" />And, not to speak of other things, there is my daily burden of anxiety about all the churches.
<verse eID="2Cor.11.28" />
<verse sID="2Cor.11.29" osisID="2Cor.11.29" n="29" />Who is weak without my being weak? Who is led astray without my burning with indignation?
<verse eID="2Cor.11.29" />
<verse sID="2Cor.11.30" osisID="2Cor.11.30" n="30" />If I must boast, I will boast of things which show my weakness!
<verse eID="2Cor.11.30" />
<verse sID="2Cor.11.31" osisID="2Cor.11.31" n="31" />The God and Father of the Lord Jesus – he who is for ever blessed – knows that I am speaking the truth.
<verse eID="2Cor.11.31" />
<verse sID="2Cor.11.32" osisID="2Cor.11.32" n="32" />When I was in Damascus, the Governor under King Aretas had the gates of that city guarded, so as to arrest me,
<verse eID="2Cor.11.32" />
<verse sID="2Cor.11.33" osisID="2Cor.11.33" n="33" />but I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall, and so escaped his hands.
<verse eID="2Cor.11.33" />
<chapter eID="2Cor.11" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="2Cor.12" osisID="2Cor.12" n="12" />
<verse sID="2Cor.12.1" osisID="2Cor.12.1" n="1" />I must boast! It is unprofitable; but I will pass to visions and revelations given by the Lord.
<verse eID="2Cor.12.1" />
<verse sID="2Cor.12.2" osisID="2Cor.12.2" n="2" />I know a man in union with Christ, who, fourteen years ago – whether in the body or out of the body I do not know; God knows – was caught up (this man of whom I am speaking) to the third heaven.
<verse eID="2Cor.12.2" />
<verse sID="2Cor.12.3" osisID="2Cor.12.3" n="3" />And I know that this man – whether in the body or separated from the body I do not know; God knows –
<verse eID="2Cor.12.3" />
<verse sID="2Cor.12.4" osisID="2Cor.12.4" n="4" />Was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable things of which no human being may tell.
<verse eID="2Cor.12.4" />
<verse sID="2Cor.12.5" osisID="2Cor.12.5" n="5" />About such a man I will boast, but about myself I will not boast except as regards my weaknesses.
<verse eID="2Cor.12.5" />
<verse sID="2Cor.12.6" osisID="2Cor.12.6" n="6" />Yet if I choose to boast, I will not be a fool; for I will be speaking no more than the truth. But I refrain, in case anyone should credit me with more than he can see in me or hear from me, and because of the marvelous character of the revelations.
<verse eID="2Cor.12.6" />
<verse sID="2Cor.12.7" osisID="2Cor.12.7" n="7" />It was for this reason, and to prevent my thinking too highly of myself, that a thorn was sent to pierce my flesh – an instrument of Satan to discipline me – so that I should not think too highly of myself.
<verse eID="2Cor.12.7" />
<verse sID="2Cor.12.8" osisID="2Cor.12.8" n="8" />About this I three times entreated the Lord, praying that it might leave me.
<verse eID="2Cor.12.8" />
<verse sID="2Cor.12.9" osisID="2Cor.12.9" n="9" />But his reply has been – <q who="Jesus" marker="">‘My help is enough for you; for my strength attains its perfection in the midst of weakness.’</q>
</p>
<p>
Most gladly, then, will I boast all the more of my weaknesses, so that the strength of the Christ may overshadow me.
<verse eID="2Cor.12.9" />
<verse sID="2Cor.12.10" osisID="2Cor.12.10" n="10" />That is why I delight in weakness, ill treatment, hardship, persecution, and difficulties, when borne for Christ. For, when I am weak, then it is that I am strong!
</p>
<verse eID="2Cor.12.10" />
<!-- s --><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>
<verse sID="2Cor.12.11" osisID="2Cor.12.11" n="11" />I have been “playing the fool!” It is you who drove me to it. For it is you who ought to have been commending me! Although I am nobody, in no respect did I prove inferior to the most eminent apostles.
<verse eID="2Cor.12.11" />
<verse sID="2Cor.12.12" osisID="2Cor.12.12" n="12" />The marks of the true apostle were exhibited among you in constant endurance, as well as by signs, by marvels, and by miracles.
<verse eID="2Cor.12.12" />
<verse sID="2Cor.12.13" osisID="2Cor.12.13" n="13" />In what respect, I ask, were you treated worse than the other churches, unless it was that, for my part, I refused to become a burden to you? Forgive me the wrong I did to you!
<verse eID="2Cor.12.13" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="2Cor.12.14" osisID="2Cor.12.14" n="14" />Remember, this is the third time that I have made every preparation to come to see you, and I will refuse to be a burden to you; I want, not your money, but you. It is not the duty of children to put by for their parents, but of parents to put by for their children.
<verse eID="2Cor.12.14" />
<verse sID="2Cor.12.15" osisID="2Cor.12.15" n="15" />For my part, I will most gladly spend, and be spent, for your welfare. Can it be that the more intensely I love you the less I am to be loved?
<verse eID="2Cor.12.15" />
<verse sID="2Cor.12.16" osisID="2Cor.12.16" n="16" />You will admit that I was not a burden to you but you say that I was “crafty” and caught you “by a trick”!
<verse eID="2Cor.12.16" />
<verse sID="2Cor.12.17" osisID="2Cor.12.17" n="17" />Do you assert that I took advantage of you through any of those whom I have sent to you?
<verse eID="2Cor.12.17" />
<verse sID="2Cor.12.18" osisID="2Cor.12.18" n="18" />I urged Titus to go, and I sent another follower with him. Did Titus take any advantage of you? Didn’t we live in the same Spirit, and tread in the same footsteps?
<verse eID="2Cor.12.18" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="2Cor.12.19" osisID="2Cor.12.19" n="19" />Have you all this time been fancying that it is to you that we are making our defense? No, it is in the sight of God, and in union with Christ, that we are speaking. And all this, dear friends, is to build up your characters;
<verse eID="2Cor.12.19" />
<verse sID="2Cor.12.20" osisID="2Cor.12.20" n="20" />for I am afraid that perhaps, when I come, I may find that you are not what I want you to be, and, on the other hand, that you may find that I am what you do not want me to be. I am afraid that I may find quarreling, jealousy, ill feeling, rivalry, slandering, backbiting, self-assertion, and disorder.
<verse eID="2Cor.12.20" />
<verse sID="2Cor.12.21" osisID="2Cor.12.21" n="21" />I am afraid that, on my next visit, my God may humble me in regard to you, and that I may have to mourn over many who have long been sinning, and have not repented of the impurity, immorality, and sensuality, in which they have indulged.
<verse eID="2Cor.12.21" />
<chapter eID="2Cor.12" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="2Cor.13" osisID="2Cor.13" n="13" />
<verse sID="2Cor.13.1" osisID="2Cor.13.1" n="1" />For the third time I am coming to see you. By the word of two or three witnesses each statement will be established.
<verse eID="2Cor.13.1" />
<verse sID="2Cor.13.2" osisID="2Cor.13.2" n="2" />I have said it, and I say it again before I come, just as if I were with you on my second visit, though for the moment absent, I say to those who have been long sinning, as well as to all others – that if I come again, I will spare no one.
<verse eID="2Cor.13.2" />
<verse sID="2Cor.13.3" osisID="2Cor.13.3" n="3" />And that will be the proof, which you are looking for, that the Christ speaks through me. There is no weakness in his dealings with you. No, he shows his power among you.
<verse eID="2Cor.13.3" />
<verse sID="2Cor.13.4" osisID="2Cor.13.4" n="4" />For though his crucifixion was due to weakness, his life is due to the power of God. And we, also, are weak in his weakness, but with him we will live for you through the power of God.
<verse eID="2Cor.13.4" />
<verse sID="2Cor.13.5" osisID="2Cor.13.5" n="5" />Put yourselves to the proof, to see whether you are holding to the faith. Test yourselves. Surely you recognize this fact about yourselves – that Jesus Christ is in you! Unless indeed you cannot stand the test!
<verse eID="2Cor.13.5" />
<verse sID="2Cor.13.6" osisID="2Cor.13.6" n="6" />But I hope that you will recognize that we can stand the test.
<verse eID="2Cor.13.6" />
<verse sID="2Cor.13.7" osisID="2Cor.13.7" n="7" />We pray God that you may do nothing wrong, not that we may be seen to stand the test, but that you may do what is right, even though we may seem not to stand the test.
<verse eID="2Cor.13.7" />
<verse sID="2Cor.13.8" osisID="2Cor.13.8" n="8" />We have no power at all against the truth, but we have power in the service of the truth.
<verse eID="2Cor.13.8" />
<verse sID="2Cor.13.9" osisID="2Cor.13.9" n="9" />We are glad when we are weak, if you are strong. And what we pray for is that you may become perfect.
<verse eID="2Cor.13.9" />
<verse sID="2Cor.13.10" osisID="2Cor.13.10" n="10" />This is my reason for writing as I am now doing, while I am away from you, so that, when I am with you, I may not act harshly in the exercise of the authority which the Lord gave me – and gave me for building up and not for pulling down.
<verse eID="2Cor.13.10" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="2Cor.13.11" osisID="2Cor.13.11" n="11" />And now, friends, goodbye. Aim at perfection; take courage; agree together; live in peace. And then God, the source of all love and peace, will be with you.
<verse eID="2Cor.13.11" />
<verse sID="2Cor.13.12" osisID="2Cor.13.12" n="12" />Greet one another with a sacred kiss.
<verse eID="2Cor.13.12" />
<verse sID="2Cor.13.13" osisID="2Cor.13.13" n="13" />All Christ’s people here send you their greetings.
<verse eID="2Cor.13.13" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="2Cor.13.14" osisID="2Cor.13.14" n="14" />May the blessing of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion with the Holy Spirit, be with you all.

<verse sID="Gal.1.1" osisID="Gal.1.1" n="1" />To the churches in Galatia, from Paul, an apostle whose commission is not from any human authority and is given, not by human beings, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead;
<verse eID="Gal.1.1" />
<verse sID="Gal.1.2" osisID="Gal.1.2" n="2" />and from all the followers of the Lord here.
<verse eID="Gal.1.2" />
<verse sID="Gal.1.3" osisID="Gal.1.3" n="3" />May God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ, bless you and give you peace. For Christ, to rescue us from this present wicked age,
<verse eID="Gal.1.3" />
<verse sID="Gal.1.4" osisID="Gal.1.4" n="4" />gave himself for our sins, in accordance with the will of God and Father,
<verse eID="Gal.1.4" />
<verse sID="Gal.1.5" osisID="Gal.1.5" n="5" />to whom be ascribed all glory for ever and ever. Amen.
<verse eID="Gal.1.5" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Gal.1.6" osisID="Gal.1.6" n="6" />I am astonished at your so soon deserting him, who called you through the love of Christ, for a different ‘good news,’
<verse eID="Gal.1.6" />
<verse sID="Gal.1.7" osisID="Gal.1.7" n="7" />which is really no good news at all. But then, I know that there are people who are harassing you, and who want to pervert the good news of the Christ.
<verse eID="Gal.1.7" />
<verse sID="Gal.1.8" osisID="Gal.1.8" n="8" />Yet even if we – or if an angel from heaven were to tell you any other ‘good news’ than that which we told you, may he be accursed!
<verse eID="Gal.1.8" />
<verse sID="Gal.1.9" osisID="Gal.1.9" n="9" />We have said it before, and I repeat it now – If anyone tells you a ‘good news’ other than that which you received, may he be accursed!
<verse eID="Gal.1.9" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Gal.1.10" osisID="Gal.1.10" n="10" />Is this, I ask, trying to conciliate people, or God? Am I seeking to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I should not be a servant of Christ.

<!-- s --><title>The Independence of the Apostle’s Gospel</title>
<p>
<verse sID="Gal.1.11" osisID="Gal.1.11" n="11" />I remind you, friends, that the good news which I told is no mere human invention.
<verse eID="Gal.1.11" />
<verse sID="Gal.1.12" osisID="Gal.1.12" n="12" />I, at least, did not receive it from any human being, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through a revelation made by Jesus Christ.
<verse eID="Gal.1.12" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Gal.1.13" osisID="Gal.1.13" n="13" />You heard, no doubt, of my conduct when I was devoted to Judaism – how I persecuted the church of God to an extent beyond belief, and made havoc of it,
<verse eID="Gal.1.13" />
<verse sID="Gal.1.14" osisID="Gal.1.14" n="14" />and how, in my devotion to Judaism, I surpassed many of my contemporaries among my own people in my intense earnestness in upholding the traditions of my ancestors.
<verse eID="Gal.1.14" />
<verse sID="Gal.1.15" osisID="Gal.1.15" n="15" />But when God, who had set me apart even before my birth, and who called me by his love,
<verse eID="Gal.1.15" />
<verse sID="Gal.1.16" osisID="Gal.1.16" n="16" />saw fit to reveal his Son in me, so that I might tell the good news of him among the Gentiles, then at once, instead of consulting any human being,
<verse eID="Gal.1.16" />
<verse sID="Gal.1.17" osisID="Gal.1.17" n="17" />or even going up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before me, I went to Arabia, and came back again to Damascus.
<verse eID="Gal.1.17" />
<verse sID="Gal.1.18" osisID="Gal.1.18" n="18" />Three years afterward I went up to Jerusalem to make the acquaintance of Peter, and I stayed a fortnight with him.
<verse eID="Gal.1.18" />
<verse sID="Gal.1.19" osisID="Gal.1.19" n="19" />I did not, however, see any other apostle, except James, the Master’s brother.
<verse eID="Gal.1.19" />
<verse sID="Gal.1.20" osisID="Gal.1.20" n="20" />(As to what I am now writing to you, I call God to witness that I am speaking the truth).
<verse eID="Gal.1.20" />
<verse sID="Gal.1.21" osisID="Gal.1.21" n="21" />Afterward I went to the districts of Syria and Cilicia.
<verse eID="Gal.1.21" />
<verse sID="Gal.1.22" osisID="Gal.1.22" n="22" />But I was still unknown even by sight to the Christian churches in Judea;
<verse eID="Gal.1.22" />
<verse sID="Gal.1.23" osisID="Gal.1.23" n="23" />all that they had heard was – ‘The man who once persecuted us is now telling the good news of the faith of which he once made havoc.’
<verse eID="Gal.1.23" />
<verse sID="Gal.1.24" osisID="Gal.1.24" n="24" />And they praised God for my sake.

<p>
<chapter sID="Gal.2" osisID="Gal.2" n="2" />
<verse sID="Gal.2.1" osisID="Gal.2.1" n="1" />Fourteen years afterward I went up to Jerusalem again with Barnabas, and I took Titus also with me.
<verse eID="Gal.2.1" />
<verse sID="Gal.2.2" osisID="Gal.2.2" n="2" />It was in obedience to a revelation that I went; and I laid before the apostles the good news that I am proclaiming among the Gentiles. I did this privately before those who are thought highly of because I was afraid that I might possibly be taking, or might have already taken, a course which would prove useless.
<verse eID="Gal.2.2" />
<verse sID="Gal.2.3" osisID="Gal.2.3" n="3" />Yet even my companion, Titus, though a Greek, was not compelled to be circumcised.
<verse eID="Gal.2.3" />
<verse sID="Gal.2.4" osisID="Gal.2.4" n="4" />But, because of those who pretended to be followers who had stolen in, the intruders who had crept in to spy on the liberty which we have through union with Christ Jesus, in order to bring us back to slavery –
<verse eID="Gal.2.4" />
<verse sID="Gal.2.5" osisID="Gal.2.5" n="5" />Why, we did not for a moment yield submission to them, so that the truth of the good news might be yours always!
<verse eID="Gal.2.5" />
<verse sID="Gal.2.6" osisID="Gal.2.6" n="6" />Of those who are thought somewhat highly of – what they once were makes no difference to me; God does not recognize human distinctions – those, I say, who are thought highly of added nothing to my message.
<verse eID="Gal.2.6" />
<verse sID="Gal.2.7" osisID="Gal.2.7" n="7" />On the contrary, they saw that I had been entrusted with the good news for the Gentiles, just as Peter had been for the Jews.
<verse eID="Gal.2.7" />
<verse sID="Gal.2.8" osisID="Gal.2.8" n="8" />For he who gave Peter power for his mission to the Jews gave me, also, power to go to the Gentiles.
<verse eID="Gal.2.8" />
<verse sID="Gal.2.9" osisID="Gal.2.9" n="9" />Recognizing the charge entrusted to me, James, Peter, and John, who were regarded as pillars of the church, openly acknowledged Barnabas and me as fellow workers, agreeing that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the Jews.
<verse eID="Gal.2.9" />
<verse sID="Gal.2.10" osisID="Gal.2.10" n="10" />Only we were to remember the poor – the thing I was myself anxious to do.
<verse eID="Gal.2.10" />
<verse sID="Gal.2.11" osisID="Gal.2.11" n="11" />But, when Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face; for he stood self-condemned.
<verse eID="Gal.2.11" />
<verse sID="Gal.2.12" osisID="Gal.2.12" n="12" />Before certain persons came from James, he had been in the habit of eating with the Gentile converts; but, when they came, he began to withdraw and hold aloof, because he was afraid of offending those who still held to circumcision.
<verse eID="Gal.2.12" />
<verse sID="Gal.2.13" osisID="Gal.2.13" n="13" />The rest of the Jewish converts were guilty of the same hypocrisy, so that even Barnabas was led away by it.
<verse eID="Gal.2.13" />
<verse sID="Gal.2.14" osisID="Gal.2.14" n="14" />But, when I saw that they were not dealing straightforwardly with the truth of the good news, I said to Peter, before them all, “If you, who were born a Jew, adopt Gentile customs, instead of Jewish, why are you trying to compel the Gentile converts to adopt Jewish customs?”
</p>

<!-- s --><title>The Law and the Gospel</title>
<p>
<verse sID="Gal.2.15" osisID="Gal.2.15" n="15" />We, though we are Jews by birth and not outcasts of Gentile origin, know that no one is pronounced righteous as the result of obedience to Law, but only through faith in Christ Jesus.
<verse eID="Gal.2.15" />
<verse sID="Gal.2.16" osisID="Gal.2.16" n="16" />So we placed our faith in Christ Jesus, in order that we might be pronounced righteous, as the result of faith in Christ, and not of obedience to Law; for such obedience will not result in even one soul’s being pronounced righteous.
<verse eID="Gal.2.16" />
<verse sID="Gal.2.17" osisID="Gal.2.17" n="17" />If, while seeking to be pronounced righteous through union with Christ, we were ourselves seen to be outcasts, would that make Christ an agent of sin? Heaven forbid!
<verse eID="Gal.2.17" />
<verse sID="Gal.2.18" osisID="Gal.2.18" n="18" />For, if I rebuild the things that I pulled down, I prove myself to have done wrong.
<verse eID="Gal.2.18" />
<verse sID="Gal.2.19" osisID="Gal.2.19" n="19" />I, indeed, through Law became dead to Law, in order to live for God.
<verse eID="Gal.2.19" />
<verse sID="Gal.2.20" osisID="Gal.2.20" n="20" />I have been crucified with Christ. So it is no longer I that live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and, as for my present earthly life, I am living it by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.
<verse eID="Gal.2.20" />
<verse sID="Gal.2.21" osisID="Gal.2.21" n="21" />I do not reject the love of God. If righteousness comes through Law, then there was no need for Christ to die!
<verse eID="Gal.2.21" />
<chapter eID="Gal.2" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Gal.3" osisID="Gal.3" n="3" />
<verse sID="Gal.3.1" osisID="Gal.3.1" n="1" />Foolish Galatians! Who has been fascinating you – you before whose eyes Jesus Christ was depicted on the cross?
<verse eID="Gal.3.1" />
<verse sID="Gal.3.2" osisID="Gal.3.2" n="2" />Here is the one thing that I want to find out from you – Did you receive the Spirit as the result of obedience to Law, or of your having listened with faith?
<verse eID="Gal.3.2" />
<verse sID="Gal.3.3" osisID="Gal.3.3" n="3" />Can you be so foolish? After beginning with what is spiritual, do you now end with what is external?
<verse eID="Gal.3.3" />
<verse sID="Gal.3.4" osisID="Gal.3.4" n="4" />Did you go through so much to no purpose? – if indeed it really was to no purpose!
<verse eID="Gal.3.4" />
<verse sID="Gal.3.5" osisID="Gal.3.5" n="5" />He who supplies you abundantly with his Spirit and endows you with such powers – does he do this as the result of obedience to Law? Or as the result of your having listened with faith?
<verse eID="Gal.3.5" />
<verse sID="Gal.3.6" osisID="Gal.3.6" n="6" />It is just as it was with Abraham –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">he had faith in God, and his faith was regarded by God as righteousness. <verse eID="Gal.3.6" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Gal.3.7" osisID="Gal.3.7" n="7" />You see, then, that those whose lives are based on faith are the sons of Abraham.
<verse eID="Gal.3.7" />
<verse sID="Gal.3.8" osisID="Gal.3.8" n="8" />And scripture, foreseeing that God would pronounce the Gentiles righteous as the result of faith, foretold the good news to Abraham in the words –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘Through you all the Gentiles will be blessed.’ <verse eID="Gal.3.8" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Gal.3.9" osisID="Gal.3.9" n="9" />And, therefore, those whose lives are based on faith share the blessings bestowed on the faith of Abraham.
<verse eID="Gal.3.9" />
<verse sID="Gal.3.10" osisID="Gal.3.10" n="10" />All who rely on obedience to Law are under a curse, for scripture says –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘Cursed is everyone who does not abide by all that is written in the book of the Law, and do it.’ <verse eID="Gal.3.10" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Gal.3.11" osisID="Gal.3.11" n="11" />Again, it is evident that no one is pronounced righteous before God through Law, for we read –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘Through faith the righteous will find life.’ <verse eID="Gal.3.11" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Gal.3.12" osisID="Gal.3.12" n="12" />But the Law is not based on faith; no, its words are –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘Those who practice these precepts will find life through them.’ <verse eID="Gal.3.12" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Gal.3.13" osisID="Gal.3.13" n="13" />Christ ransomed us from the curse pronounced in the Law, by taking the curse on himself for us, for scripture says –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘Cursed is anyone who is hanged on a tree.’ <verse eID="Gal.3.13" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Gal.3.14" osisID="Gal.3.14" n="14" />And this he did that the blessing given to Abraham might be extended to the Gentiles through their union with Jesus Christ; that so, through our faith, we also might receive the promised gift of the Spirit.
<verse eID="Gal.3.14" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Gal.3.15" osisID="Gal.3.15" n="15" />To take an illustration, friends, from daily life – No one sets aside even an agreement between two people, when once it has been confirmed, nor do they add conditions to it.
<verse eID="Gal.3.15" />
<verse sID="Gal.3.16" osisID="Gal.3.16" n="16" />Now it was to Abraham that the promises were made, ‘and to his offspring.’ It was not said ‘to his offsprings,’ as if many persons were meant, but the words were ‘to your offspring,’ showing that one person was meant – and that was Christ.
<verse eID="Gal.3.16" />
<verse sID="Gal.3.17" osisID="Gal.3.17" n="17" />My point is this – An agreement already confirmed by God cannot be canceled by the Law, which came four hundred and thirty years later, so as to cause the promise to be set aside.
<verse eID="Gal.3.17" />
<verse sID="Gal.3.18" osisID="Gal.3.18" n="18" />If our heritage is the result of Law, then it has ceased to be the result of a promise. Yet God conferred it on Abraham by a promise.
<verse eID="Gal.3.18" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Gal.3.19" osisID="Gal.3.19" n="19" />What, then, you ask, was the use of the Law? It was a later addition, to make people conscious of their wrong-doings, and intended to last only until the coming of that offspring to whom the promise had been made; and it was delivered through angels by a mediator.
<verse eID="Gal.3.19" />
<verse sID="Gal.3.20" osisID="Gal.3.20" n="20" />Now mediation implies more than one person, but God is one only.
<verse eID="Gal.3.20" />
<verse sID="Gal.3.21" osisID="Gal.3.21" n="21" />Does that set the Law in opposition to God’s promises? Heaven forbid! For, if a Law had been given capable of bestowing life, then righteousness would have actually owed its existence to Law.
<verse eID="Gal.3.21" />
<verse sID="Gal.3.22" osisID="Gal.3.22" n="22" />But the words of scripture represent the whole world as being in bondage to sin, so that the promised blessing, dependent, as it is, on faith in Jesus Christ, may be given to those who have faith in him.
<verse eID="Gal.3.22" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Gal.3.23" osisID="Gal.3.23" n="23" />Before the coming of faith, we were kept under the guard of the Law, in bondage, awaiting the faith that was destined to be revealed.
<verse eID="Gal.3.23" />
<verse sID="Gal.3.24" osisID="Gal.3.24" n="24" />Thus the Law has proved a guide to lead us to Christ, in order that we may be pronounced righteous as the result of faith.
<verse eID="Gal.3.24" />
<verse sID="Gal.3.25" osisID="Gal.3.25" n="25" />But now that faith has come we no longer need a guide.
<verse eID="Gal.3.25" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Gal.3.26" osisID="Gal.3.26" n="26" />For you are all sons of God, through your faith in Christ Jesus.
<verse eID="Gal.3.26" />
<verse sID="Gal.3.27" osisID="Gal.3.27" n="27" />For all of you who were baptized into union with Christ clothed yourselves with Christ.
<verse eID="Gal.3.27" />
<verse sID="Gal.3.28" osisID="Gal.3.28" n="28" />All distinctions between Jew and Greek, slave and free, male and female, have vanished; for in union with Christ Jesus you are all one.
<verse eID="Gal.3.28" />
<verse sID="Gal.3.29" osisID="Gal.3.29" n="29" />And, since you belong to Christ, it follows that you are Abraham’s offspring and, under the promise, sharers in the inheritance.
<verse eID="Gal.3.29" />
<chapter eID="Gal.3" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Gal.4" osisID="Gal.4" n="4" />
<verse sID="Gal.4.1" osisID="Gal.4.1" n="1" />My point is this – As long as the heir is under age, there is no difference between him and a slave, though he is master of the whole estate.
<verse eID="Gal.4.1" />
<verse sID="Gal.4.2" osisID="Gal.4.2" n="2" />He is subject to the control of guardians and stewards, during the period for which his father has power to appoint them.
<verse eID="Gal.4.2" />
<verse sID="Gal.4.3" osisID="Gal.4.3" n="3" />And so is it with us; when we were under age, as it were, we were slaves to the puerile teaching of this world;
<verse eID="Gal.4.3" />
<verse sID="Gal.4.4" osisID="Gal.4.4" n="4" />but, when the full time came, God sent his Son – born a woman’s child, born subject to Law –
<verse eID="Gal.4.4" />
<verse sID="Gal.4.5" osisID="Gal.4.5" n="5" />To ransom those who were subject to Law, so that we might take our position as sons.
<verse eID="Gal.4.5" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Gal.4.6" osisID="Gal.4.6" n="6" />And it is because you are sons that God sent into our hearts the Spirit of his Son, with the cry – ‘Abba, our Father.’
<verse eID="Gal.4.6" />
<verse sID="Gal.4.7" osisID="Gal.4.7" n="7" />You, therefore, are no longer a slave, but a son; and, if a son, then an heir also, by God’s appointment.
<verse eID="Gal.4.7" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Gal.4.8" osisID="Gal.4.8" n="8" />Yet formerly, in your ignorance of God, you became slaves to ‘gods’ which were no gods.
<verse eID="Gal.4.8" />
<verse sID="Gal.4.9" osisID="Gal.4.9" n="9" />But now that you have found God – or, rather, have been found by him – how is it that you are turning back to that poor and feeble puerile teaching, to which yet once again you are wanting to become slaves?
<verse eID="Gal.4.9" />
<verse sID="Gal.4.10" osisID="Gal.4.10" n="10" />You are scrupulous in keeping days and months and seasons and years!
<verse eID="Gal.4.10" />
<verse sID="Gal.4.11" osisID="Gal.4.11" n="11" />You make me fear that the labor which I have spent on you may have been wasted.
<verse eID="Gal.4.11" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Gal.4.12" osisID="Gal.4.12" n="12" />I entreat you, friends, to become like me, as I became like you. You have never done me any wrong.
<verse eID="Gal.4.12" />
<verse sID="Gal.4.13" osisID="Gal.4.13" n="13" />You remember that it was owing to bodily infirmity that on the first occasion I told you the good news.
<verse eID="Gal.4.13" />
<verse sID="Gal.4.14" osisID="Gal.4.14" n="14" />And as for what must have tried you in my condition, it did not inspire you with scorn or disgust, but you welcomed me as if I had been an angel of God – or Christ Jesus himself!
<verse eID="Gal.4.14" />
<verse sID="Gal.4.15" osisID="Gal.4.15" n="15" />What has become then, of your blessings? For I can bear witness that, had it been possible, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me!
<verse eID="Gal.4.15" />
<verse sID="Gal.4.16" osisID="Gal.4.16" n="16" />Am I to think, then, that I have become your enemy by telling you the truth?
<verse eID="Gal.4.16" />
<verse sID="Gal.4.17" osisID="Gal.4.17" n="17" />Certain people are seeking your favor, but with no honorable object. No, indeed, they want to isolate you, so that you will have to seek their favor.
<verse eID="Gal.4.17" />
<verse sID="Gal.4.18" osisID="Gal.4.18" n="18" />It is always honorable to have your favor sought in an honorable cause, and not only when I am with you, my dear children –
<verse eID="Gal.4.18" />
<verse sID="Gal.4.19" osisID="Gal.4.19" n="19" />you for whom I am again enduring a mother’s pains, until a likeness to Christ will have been formed in you.
<verse eID="Gal.4.19" />
<verse sID="Gal.4.20" osisID="Gal.4.20" n="20" />But I could wish to be with you now and speak in a different tone, for I am perplexed about you.
<verse eID="Gal.4.20" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Gal.4.21" osisID="Gal.4.21" n="21" />Tell me, you who want to be still subject to Law – Why don’t you listen to the Law?
<verse eID="Gal.4.21" />
<verse sID="Gal.4.22" osisID="Gal.4.22" n="22" />Scripture says that Abraham had two sons, one the child of the slave-woman and the other the child of the free woman.
<verse eID="Gal.4.22" />
<verse sID="Gal.4.23" osisID="Gal.4.23" n="23" />But the child of the slave-woman was born in the course of nature, while the child of the free woman was born in fulfillment of a promise.
<verse eID="Gal.4.23" />
<verse sID="Gal.4.24" osisID="Gal.4.24" n="24" />This story may be taken as an allegory. The women stand for two Covenants. One covenant, given from Mount Sinai, produces a race of slaves and is represented by Hagar
<verse eID="Gal.4.24" />
<verse sID="Gal.4.25" osisID="Gal.4.25" n="25" />(The word Hagar meaning in Arabia Mount Sinai) and it ranks with the Jerusalem of today, for she and her children are in slavery.
<verse eID="Gal.4.25" />
<verse sID="Gal.4.26" osisID="Gal.4.26" n="26" />But the Jerusalem above is free, and she it is who is our mother.
<verse eID="Gal.4.26" />
<verse sID="Gal.4.27" osisID="Gal.4.27" n="27" />For scripture says –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘Rejoice, you barren one, who does never bear,</l>
<l level="1">break into shouts, you who are never in labor,</l>
<l level="2">for many are the children of her who is desolate –</l>

</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Gal.4.28" osisID="Gal.4.28" n="28" />As for ourselves, friends, we, like Isaac, are children born in fulfillment of a promise.

<verse sID="Gal.4.29" osisID="Gal.4.29" n="29" />Yet at that time the child born in the course of nature persecuted the child born by the power of the Spirit; and it is the same now.

<verse sID="Gal.4.31" osisID="Gal.4.31" n="31" />And so, friends, we are not children of a slave, but of her who is free.

<!-- s --><title>The Gospel in the Daily Life</title>
<p>
<verse sID="Gal.5.1" osisID="Gal.5.1" n="1" />It is for freedom that Christ set us free; stand firm therefore, and do not again be held under the yoke of slavery.
<verse eID="Gal.5.1" />
<lb type="x-p" />
<verse sID="Gal.5.2" osisID="Gal.5.2" n="2" />Understand that I, Paul, myself tell you that if you allow yourselves to be circumcised, Christ will avail you nothing.
<verse eID="Gal.5.2" />
<verse sID="Gal.5.3" osisID="Gal.5.3" n="3" />I again declare to everyone who receives circumcision, that he binds himself to obey the whole Law.
<verse eID="Gal.5.3" />
<verse sID="Gal.5.4" osisID="Gal.5.4" n="4" />You have severed yourselves from Christ – you who are seeking to be pronounced righteous through Law; you have fallen away from love.
<verse eID="Gal.5.4" />
<verse sID="Gal.5.5" osisID="Gal.5.5" n="5" />For we, by the help of the Spirit, are eagerly waiting for the fulfillment of our hope – that we may be pronounced righteous as the result of faith.
<verse eID="Gal.5.5" />
<verse sID="Gal.5.6" osisID="Gal.5.6" n="6" />If we are in union with Christ Jesus, neither is circumcision nor the omission of it anything, but faith, working through love, is everything.
<verse eID="Gal.5.6" />
<verse sID="Gal.5.7" osisID="Gal.5.7" n="7" />You were once making good progress! Who has hindered you from obeying the truth?
<verse eID="Gal.5.7" />
<verse sID="Gal.5.8" osisID="Gal.5.8" n="8" />The persuasion brought to bear on you does not come from him who calls you.
<verse eID="Gal.5.8" />
<verse sID="Gal.5.9" osisID="Gal.5.9" n="9" />A little leaven leavens all the dough.
<verse eID="Gal.5.9" />
<verse sID="Gal.5.10" osisID="Gal.5.10" n="10" />I, through my union with the Lord, am persuaded that you will learn to think with me. But the man who is disturbing your minds will have to bear his punishment, whoever he may be.
<verse eID="Gal.5.10" />
<verse sID="Gal.5.11" osisID="Gal.5.11" n="11" />If I, friends, am still proclaiming circumcision, why am I still persecuted? It seems that the cross has ceased to be an obstacle!
<verse eID="Gal.5.11" />
<verse sID="Gal.5.12" osisID="Gal.5.12" n="12" />I could even wish that the people who are unsettling you would go further still and mutilate themselves.
<verse eID="Gal.5.12" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Gal.5.13" osisID="Gal.5.13" n="13" />Remember, friends, to you the call came to give you freedom. Only do not make your freedom an opportunity for self-indulgence, but serve one another in a loving spirit.
<verse eID="Gal.5.13" />
<verse sID="Gal.5.14" osisID="Gal.5.14" n="14" />Indeed, the whole Law has been summed up in this one precept –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘You must love your neighbor as you love yourself.’ <verse eID="Gal.5.14" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Gal.5.15" osisID="Gal.5.15" n="15" />But, if you are continually wounding and preying on one another, take care that you are not destroyed by one another.
<verse eID="Gal.5.15" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Gal.5.16" osisID="Gal.5.16" n="16" />This is what I have to say – Let your steps be guided by the Spirit, and then you will never gratify the cravings of your earthly nature.
<verse eID="Gal.5.16" />
<verse sID="Gal.5.17" osisID="Gal.5.17" n="17" />For these cravings of our earthly nature conflict with the Spirit, and the Spirit with our earthly nature – they are two contrary principles – so that you cannot do what you wish.
<verse eID="Gal.5.17" />
<verse sID="Gal.5.18" osisID="Gal.5.18" n="18" />But, if you follow the guidance of the Spirit, you are not subject to Law.
<verse eID="Gal.5.18" />
<verse sID="Gal.5.19" osisID="Gal.5.19" n="19" />The sins of our earthly nature are unmistakable. They are sins like these – sexual immorality, impurity, indecency,
<verse eID="Gal.5.19" />
<verse sID="Gal.5.20" osisID="Gal.5.20" n="20" />idolatry, sorcery, quarrels, strife, jealousy, outbursts of passion, rivalries, dissensions, divisions,
<verse eID="Gal.5.20" />
<verse sID="Gal.5.21" osisID="Gal.5.21" n="21" />feelings of envy, drunkenness, revelry, and the like. And I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who indulge in such things will have no place in the kingdom of God.
<verse eID="Gal.5.21" />
<verse sID="Gal.5.22" osisID="Gal.5.22" n="22" />But the fruit produced by the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindliness, generosity, trustfulness, gentleness, self-control.
<verse eID="Gal.5.22" />
<verse sID="Gal.5.23" osisID="Gal.5.23" n="23" />Against such things there is no law!
<verse eID="Gal.5.23" />
<verse sID="Gal.5.24" osisID="Gal.5.24" n="24" />And those who belong to Jesus, the Christ, have already crucified their earthly nature, with its passions and its cravings.
<verse eID="Gal.5.24" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Gal.5.25" osisID="Gal.5.25" n="25" />Since our life is due to the Spirit, let us rule our conduct also by the Spirit.
<verse eID="Gal.5.25" />
<verse sID="Gal.5.26" osisID="Gal.5.26" n="26" />Do not let us grow vain, and provoke or envy one another.
<verse eID="Gal.5.26" />
<chapter eID="Gal.5" />
<chapter sID="Gal.6" osisID="Gal.6" n="6" />
<verse sID="Gal.6.1" osisID="Gal.6.1" n="1" />My friends, even if someone should be caught committing a sin, you who are spiritually minded should, in a gentle spirit, help them to recover themselves, taking care that you yourselves are not tempted.
<verse eID="Gal.6.1" />
<verse sID="Gal.6.2" osisID="Gal.6.2" n="2" />Bear one another’s burdens, and so carry out the Law of the Christ.
<verse eID="Gal.6.2" />
<verse sID="Gal.6.3" osisID="Gal.6.3" n="3" />If a person imagines themselves to be somebody, when they are really nobody, they deceive themselves.
<verse eID="Gal.6.3" />
<verse sID="Gal.6.4" osisID="Gal.6.4" n="4" />Let everyone test their own work, and then their cause for satisfaction will be in themselves and not in a comparison with their neighbor;
<verse eID="Gal.6.4" />
<verse sID="Gal.6.5" osisID="Gal.6.5" n="5" />for everyone must bear their own load.
<verse eID="Gal.6.5" />
<verse sID="Gal.6.6" osisID="Gal.6.6" n="6" />The person, however, who is being instructed in the message ought always to share their blessings with their teacher.
<verse eID="Gal.6.6" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Gal.6.7" osisID="Gal.6.7" n="7" />Do not be deceived. God cannot be mocked. What a person sows that they will reap.
<verse eID="Gal.6.7" />
<verse sID="Gal.6.8" osisID="Gal.6.8" n="8" />For the person who sows the field of their earthly nature will from that earthly nature reap corruption; while the one who sows the field of the spirit will from that spirit reap eternal life.
<verse eID="Gal.6.8" />
<verse sID="Gal.6.9" osisID="Gal.6.9" n="9" />Let us never tire of doing right, for at the proper season we will reap our harvest, if we do not grow weary.
<verse eID="Gal.6.9" />
<verse sID="Gal.6.10" osisID="Gal.6.10" n="10" />Therefore, I say, as the opportunity occurs, let us treat everyone with kindness, and especially members of the Household of the faith.

<!-- s --><title>Conclusion in the Apostle’s own handwriting</title>
<p>
<verse sID="Gal.6.11" osisID="Gal.6.11" n="11" />See in what large letters I am writing with my own hand.
<verse eID="Gal.6.11" />
<verse sID="Gal.6.12" osisID="Gal.6.12" n="12" />Those who wish to appear to advantage in regard to outward observances are the people who are trying to compel you to be circumcised; and they do it only to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Jesus, the Christ.
<verse eID="Gal.6.12" />
<verse sID="Gal.6.13" osisID="Gal.6.13" n="13" />Even these men who are circumcised do not themselves keep the Law; yet they want you to be circumcised, so that they may boast of your observance of the rite.
<verse eID="Gal.6.13" />
<verse sID="Gal.6.14" osisID="Gal.6.14" n="14" />But, for my part, may I never boast of anything except the cross of Jesus Christ, our Master, through whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.
<verse eID="Gal.6.14" />
<verse sID="Gal.6.15" osisID="Gal.6.15" n="15" />For neither is circumcision nor the omission of it anything; but a new nature is everything.
<verse eID="Gal.6.15" />
<verse sID="Gal.6.16" osisID="Gal.6.16" n="16" />May all who rule their conduct by this principle find peace and mercy – they who are the Israel of God.
<verse eID="Gal.6.16" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Gal.6.17" osisID="Gal.6.17" n="17" />For the future let no one trouble me; for I bear the marks of Jesus branded on my body.
<verse eID="Gal.6.17" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Gal.6.18" osisID="Gal.6.18" n="18" />May the blessing of Jesus Christ, our Lord, rest on your souls, friends. Amen.

<p>
<verse sID="Eph.1.1" osisID="Eph.1.1" n="1" />To Christ’s people at Ephesus who are faithful to him, from Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, by the will of God.
<verse eID="Eph.1.1" />
<verse sID="Eph.1.2" osisID="Eph.1.2" n="2" />May God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace.
<verse eID="Eph.1.2" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Eph.1.3" osisID="Eph.1.3" n="3" />Blessed is the God and Father of Jesus Christ, our Lord, who has blessed us on high with every spiritual blessing, in Christ.
<verse eID="Eph.1.3" />
<verse sID="Eph.1.4" osisID="Eph.1.4" n="4" />For he chose us in our union with Christ before the creation of the universe, so that we might be holy and blameless in his sight, living in the spirit of love.
<verse eID="Eph.1.4" />
<verse sID="Eph.1.5" osisID="Eph.1.5" n="5" />From the first he destined us, in his goodwill towards us, to be adopted as sons through Jesus Christ,
<verse eID="Eph.1.5" />
<verse sID="Eph.1.6" osisID="Eph.1.6" n="6" />and so to enhance that glorious manifestation of his loving kindness which he gave us in the one he loves;
<verse eID="Eph.1.6" />
<verse sID="Eph.1.7" osisID="Eph.1.7" n="7" />for in him, and through the shedding of his blood, we have found redemption in the pardon of our offenses.
<verse eID="Eph.1.7" />
<verse sID="Eph.1.8" osisID="Eph.1.8" n="8" />All this accords with the loving kindness which God lavished on us, accompanied by countless gifts of wisdom and discernment,
<verse eID="Eph.1.8" />
<verse sID="Eph.1.9" osisID="Eph.1.9" n="9" />when he made known to us his hidden purpose. And it also accords with the goodwill which God purposed to exhibit in Christ,
<verse eID="Eph.1.9" />
<verse sID="Eph.1.10" osisID="Eph.1.10" n="10" />in view of that divine order which was to mark the completion of the ages, when he should make everything, both in heaven and on earth, centre in him.
<verse eID="Eph.1.10" />
<verse sID="Eph.1.11" osisID="Eph.1.11" n="11" />In him, I say, for by our union with him we became God’s heritage, having from the first been destined for this in the intention of him who, in all that happens, is carrying out his own fixed purpose;
<verse eID="Eph.1.11" />
<verse sID="Eph.1.12" osisID="Eph.1.12" n="12" />that we should enhance his glory – we who have been the first to rest our hopes on the Christ.
<verse eID="Eph.1.12" />
<verse sID="Eph.1.13" osisID="Eph.1.13" n="13" />And you, too, by your union with him, after you had heard the message of the truth, the good news of your salvation – you believed in him and were sealed as his by receiving the holy Spirit, which he had promised.
<verse eID="Eph.1.13" />
<verse sID="Eph.1.14" osisID="Eph.1.14" n="14" />And the Spirit is a pledge of our future heritage, foreshadowing the full redemption of God’s own people – to enhance his glory.

<!-- s --><title>The power of God displayed in Christ, the Head of the Church</title>
<p>
<verse sID="Eph.1.15" osisID="Eph.1.15" n="15" />And therefore I, ever since I heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which prevails among you, and of your confidence in all Christ’s people,
<verse eID="Eph.1.15" />
<verse sID="Eph.1.16" osisID="Eph.1.16" n="16" />have never omitted to thank God on your behalf, whenever I make mention of you in my prayers.
<verse eID="Eph.1.16" />
<verse sID="Eph.1.17" osisID="Eph.1.17" n="17" />My prayer is that the God of Jesus Christ our Lord, the all-glorious Father, may inspire you with wisdom and true insight through a fuller knowledge of himself;
<verse eID="Eph.1.17" />
<verse sID="Eph.1.18" osisID="Eph.1.18" n="18" />that your minds may be so enlightened that you may realize the hope given by God’s call, the wealth of the glory of his heritage among Christ’s people,
<verse eID="Eph.1.18" />
<verse sID="Eph.1.19" osisID="Eph.1.19" n="19" />and the transcendent greatness of the power which he is able to exercise in dealing with us who believe in him.
<verse eID="Eph.1.19" />
<verse sID="Eph.1.20" osisID="Eph.1.20" n="20" />The same mighty power was exerted on the Christ, when he raised the Christ from the dead and ‘caused him to sit at his right hand’ on high, exalting him above all angels and archangels of every rank,
<verse eID="Eph.1.20" />
<verse sID="Eph.1.21" osisID="Eph.1.21" n="21" />and above every name that can be named, whether in the present age, or in the age to come.
<verse eID="Eph.1.21" />
<verse sID="Eph.1.22" osisID="Eph.1.22" n="22" />And God placed all things under Christ’s feet, and gave him to the church as its supreme head;
<verse eID="Eph.1.22" />
<verse sID="Eph.1.23" osisID="Eph.1.23" n="23" />for the church is Christ’s body, and is filled by him who fills all things everywhere with his presence.
<verse eID="Eph.1.23" />
<chapter eID="Eph.1" />
<chapter sID="Eph.2" osisID="Eph.2" n="2" />
<verse sID="Eph.2.1" osisID="Eph.2.1" n="1" />You yourselves were once dead because of your offenses and sins.
<verse eID="Eph.2.1" />
<verse sID="Eph.2.2" osisID="Eph.2.2" n="2" />For at one time you lived in sin, following the ways of the world, in subjection to the Ruler of the powers of the air – the Spirit who is still at work among the disobedient.
<verse eID="Eph.2.2" />
<verse sID="Eph.2.3" osisID="Eph.2.3" n="3" />And it was among them that we all once lived our lives, indulging the cravings of our earthly nature, and carrying out the desires prompted by that earthly nature and by our own thoughts. Our nature exposed us to the divine wrath, like the rest of humanity.
<verse eID="Eph.2.3" />
<verse sID="Eph.2.4" osisID="Eph.2.4" n="4" />Yet God, in his abundant compassion, and because of the great love with which he loved us,
<verse eID="Eph.2.4" />
<verse sID="Eph.2.5" osisID="Eph.2.5" n="5" />even though we were dead because of our offenses, gave life to us in giving life to the Christ. (By God’s loving kindness you have been saved.)
<verse eID="Eph.2.5" />
<verse sID="Eph.2.6" osisID="Eph.2.6" n="6" />And, through our union with Christ Jesus, God raised us with him, and caused us to sit with him on high,
<verse eID="Eph.2.6" />
<verse sID="Eph.2.7" osisID="Eph.2.7" n="7" />in order that, by his goodness to us in Christ Jesus, he might display in the ages to come the boundless wealth of his loving kindness.
<verse eID="Eph.2.7" />
<verse sID="Eph.2.8" osisID="Eph.2.8" n="8" />For it is by God’s loving kindness that you have been saved, through your faith. It is not due to yourselves; the gift is God’s.
<verse eID="Eph.2.8" />
<verse sID="Eph.2.9" osisID="Eph.2.9" n="9" />It is not due to obedience to Law, so that no one can boast.
<verse eID="Eph.2.9" />
<verse sID="Eph.2.10" osisID="Eph.2.10" n="10" />For we are God’s handiwork, created, by our union with Christ Jesus, for the good actions in doing which God had pre-arranged that we should spend our lives.
<verse eID="Eph.2.10" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Eph.2.11" osisID="Eph.2.11" n="11" />Remember, therefore, that you were once Gentiles yourselves, as your bodies showed; you were called ‘the Uncircumcised’ by those who were called ‘the Circumcised’ – circumcised only by human hands!
<verse eID="Eph.2.11" />
<verse sID="Eph.2.12" osisID="Eph.2.12" n="12" />Remember that you were at that time far from Christ; you were shut out from the citizenship of Israel; you were strangers to the Covenants founded on God’s Promise; you were in the world without hope and without God.
<verse eID="Eph.2.12" />
<verse sID="Eph.2.13" osisID="Eph.2.13" n="13" />But now, through your union with Christ Jesus, you who once were far off have, by the shedding of the blood of the Christ, been brought near.
<verse eID="Eph.2.13" />
<verse sID="Eph.2.14" osisID="Eph.2.14" n="14" />He it is who is our peace. He made the two divisions of humanity one, broke down the barrier that separated them,
<verse eID="Eph.2.14" />
<verse sID="Eph.2.15" osisID="Eph.2.15" n="15" />and in his human nature put an end to the cause of enmity between them – the Law with its injunctions and ordinances – in order to create, through union with himself, from Jew and Gentile, one new humanity and so make peace.
<verse eID="Eph.2.15" />
<verse sID="Eph.2.16" osisID="Eph.2.16" n="16" />And when, on the cross, he had destroyed their mutual enmity, he sought by means of his cross to reconcile them both to God, united in one body.
<verse eID="Eph.2.16" />
<verse sID="Eph.2.17" osisID="Eph.2.17" n="17" />He came with the good news of peace for you who were far off, and of peace for those who were near;
<verse eID="Eph.2.17" />
<verse sID="Eph.2.18" osisID="Eph.2.18" n="18" />for it is through him that we, the Jews and the Gentiles, united in the one Spirit, are now able to approach the Father.
<verse eID="Eph.2.18" />
<verse sID="Eph.2.19" osisID="Eph.2.19" n="19" />It follows, then, that you are no longer strangers and aliens, but are fellow citizens with Christ’s people and members of God’s Household.
<verse eID="Eph.2.19" />
<verse sID="Eph.2.20" osisID="Eph.2.20" n="20" />You have been built up on the foundation laid by the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the corner-stone.
<verse eID="Eph.2.20" />
<verse sID="Eph.2.21" osisID="Eph.2.21" n="21" />United in him, every part of the building, closely joined together, will grow into a Temple, consecrated by its union with the Lord.
<verse eID="Eph.2.21" />
<verse sID="Eph.2.22" osisID="Eph.2.22" n="22" />And, through union in him, you also are being built up together, to be a place where God lives through the Spirit.

<!-- s --><title>The Apostle’s Divine Commission to the Gentiles</title>
<p>
<verse sID="Eph.3.1" osisID="Eph.3.1" n="1" />For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Jesus, the Christ, for the sake of you Gentiles –
<verse eID="Eph.3.1" />
<verse sID="Eph.3.2" osisID="Eph.3.2" n="2" />For you have heard, I suppose, of the responsible charge with which God entrusted me for your benefit,
<verse eID="Eph.3.2" />
<verse sID="Eph.3.3" osisID="Eph.3.3" n="3" />and also that it was by direct revelation that the hidden purpose of God was made known to me, as I have already briefly told you.
<verse eID="Eph.3.3" />
<verse sID="Eph.3.4" osisID="Eph.3.4" n="4" />And, by reading what I have written, you will be able to judge how far I understand this hidden purpose of God in Christ.
<verse eID="Eph.3.4" />
<verse sID="Eph.3.5" osisID="Eph.3.5" n="5" />In former generations it was not made known to humanity, as fully as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to the apostles and prophets among Christ’s people –
<verse eID="Eph.3.5" />
<verse sID="Eph.3.6" osisID="Eph.3.6" n="6" />That, by union with Christ Jesus and through the good news, the Gentiles are coheirs with us and members of one body, and that they share with us in God’s Promise.
<verse eID="Eph.3.6" />
<verse sID="Eph.3.7" osisID="Eph.3.7" n="7" />Of this good news I become an assistant, in virtue of the charge with which God entrusted me in the exercise of his power –
<verse eID="Eph.3.7" />
<verse sID="Eph.3.8" osisID="Eph.3.8" n="8" />Yes, to me, who am less than the least of all Christ’s people, was this charge entrusted! – to tell the Gentiles the good news of the boundless wealth to be found in the Christ,
<verse eID="Eph.3.8" />
<verse sID="Eph.3.9" osisID="Eph.3.9" n="9" />and to make clear what is God’s way of working out that hidden purpose which from the first has been concealed in the mind of the Creator of all things;
<verse eID="Eph.3.9" />
<verse sID="Eph.3.10" osisID="Eph.3.10" n="10" />so that now to the archangels and to all the powers on high should be made known, through the church, the all-embracing wisdom of God,
<verse eID="Eph.3.10" />
<verse sID="Eph.3.11" osisID="Eph.3.11" n="11" />in accordance with that purpose which runs through all the ages and which he has now accomplished in Jesus, the Christ, our Master.
<verse eID="Eph.3.11" />
<verse sID="Eph.3.12" osisID="Eph.3.12" n="12" />And in union with him, and through our trust in him, we find courage to approach God with confidence.
<verse eID="Eph.3.12" />
<verse sID="Eph.3.13" osisID="Eph.3.13" n="13" />Therefore I beg you not to be disheartened at the sufferings that I am undergoing for your sakes; for they redound to your honor.
<verse eID="Eph.3.13" />
<verse sID="Eph.3.14" osisID="Eph.3.14" n="14" />For this reason, then, I kneel before the Father –
<verse eID="Eph.3.14" />
<verse sID="Eph.3.15" osisID="Eph.3.15" n="15" />from whom all ‘fatherhood’ in heaven and on earth derives its name –
<verse eID="Eph.3.15" />
<verse sID="Eph.3.16" osisID="Eph.3.16" n="16" />And pray that, in proportion to the wealth of his glory, he will strengthen you with his power by breathing his Spirit into your inmost soul,
<verse eID="Eph.3.16" />
<verse sID="Eph.3.17" osisID="Eph.3.17" n="17" />so that the Christ, through your faith, may make his home within your hearts in love; And I pray that you, now firmly rooted and established, may, with all Christ’s people,
<verse eID="Eph.3.17" />
<verse sID="Eph.3.18" osisID="Eph.3.18" n="18" />have the power to comprehend in all its width and length and height and depth,
<verse eID="Eph.3.18" />
<verse sID="Eph.3.19" osisID="Eph.3.19" n="19" />and to understand – though it surpasses all understanding – the love of the Christ; and so be filled to the full with God himself.
<verse eID="Eph.3.19" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Eph.3.20" osisID="Eph.3.20" n="20" />To him who, through his power which is at work within us, is able to do far more than anything that we can ask or conceive –
<verse eID="Eph.3.20" />
<verse sID="Eph.3.21" osisID="Eph.3.21" n="21" />To him be all glory through the church and through Christ Jesus, for all generations, age after age. Amen.

<p>
<verse sID="Eph.4.1" osisID="Eph.4.1" n="1" />I beg you, then – I who am a prisoner in the Master’s cause – to live lives worthy of the call that you have received;
<verse eID="Eph.4.1" />
<verse sID="Eph.4.2" osisID="Eph.4.2" n="2" />always humble and gentle, patient, bearing lovingly with one another,
<verse eID="Eph.4.2" />
<verse sID="Eph.4.3" osisID="Eph.4.3" n="3" />and striving to maintain in the bond of peace the unity given by the Spirit.
<verse eID="Eph.4.3" />
<verse sID="Eph.4.4" osisID="Eph.4.4" n="4" />There is but one body and one Spirit, just as there was but one hope set before you when you received your call.
<verse eID="Eph.4.4" />
<verse sID="Eph.4.5" osisID="Eph.4.5" n="5" />There is but one Lord, one faith, one baptism.
<verse eID="Eph.4.5" />
<verse sID="Eph.4.6" osisID="Eph.4.6" n="6" />There is but one God and Father of all – the God who is over all, pervades all, and is in all.
<verse eID="Eph.4.6" />
<verse sID="Eph.4.7" osisID="Eph.4.7" n="7" />Everyone of us, however, has been entrusted with some charge, each in accordance with the extent of the gift of the Christ.
<verse eID="Eph.4.7" />
<verse sID="Eph.4.8" osisID="Eph.4.8" n="8" />That is why it is said –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘When he went up on high, he led his captives into captivity. And gave gifts to humanity.’ <verse eID="Eph.4.8" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Eph.4.9" osisID="Eph.4.9" n="9" />Now surely this ‘going up’ must imply that he had already gone down into the world beneath.
<verse eID="Eph.4.9" />
<verse sID="Eph.4.10" osisID="Eph.4.10" n="10" />He who went down is the same as he who went up – up beyond the highest heaven, so that he might fill all things with his presence.
<verse eID="Eph.4.10" />
<verse sID="Eph.4.11" osisID="Eph.4.11" n="11" />And he it is who gave to the church apostles, prophets, missionaries, pastors, and teachers,
<verse eID="Eph.4.11" />
<verse sID="Eph.4.12" osisID="Eph.4.12" n="12" />to fit his people for the work of the ministry, for the building up of the body of the Christ.
<verse eID="Eph.4.12" />
<verse sID="Eph.4.13" osisID="Eph.4.13" n="13" />And this will continue, until we all attain to that unity which is given by faith and by a fuller knowledge of the Son of God; until we reach maturity – the full standard of the perfection of the Christ.
<verse eID="Eph.4.13" />
<verse sID="Eph.4.14" osisID="Eph.4.14" n="14" />Then we will no longer be like infants, tossed backward and forward, blown about by every breath of human teaching and by people’s trickery and craftiness;
<verse eID="Eph.4.14" />
<verse sID="Eph.4.15" osisID="Eph.4.15" n="15" />but holding the truth in a spirit of love, we will grow into complete union with him who is our head – Christ himself.
<verse eID="Eph.4.15" />
<verse sID="Eph.4.16" osisID="Eph.4.16" n="16" />For from him the whole body, closely joined and knit together by the contact of every part with the source of its life, derives its power to grow, in proportion to the vigour of each individual part; and so is being built up in a spirit of love.
<verse eID="Eph.4.16" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Eph.4.17" osisID="Eph.4.17" n="17" />This, then, as one in union with the Lord, I implore: Do not continue to live such purposeless lives as the Gentiles live,
<verse eID="Eph.4.17" />
<verse sID="Eph.4.18" osisID="Eph.4.18" n="18" />with their powers of discernment darkened, cut off from the life of God, owing to the ignorance that prevails among them and to the hardness of their hearts.
<verse eID="Eph.4.18" />
<verse sID="Eph.4.19" osisID="Eph.4.19" n="19" />Lost to all sense of shame, they have abandoned themselves to licentiousness, in order to practice every kind of impurity without restraint.
<verse eID="Eph.4.19" />
<verse sID="Eph.4.20" osisID="Eph.4.20" n="20" />But far different is the lesson you learned from the Christ – if, that is, you really listened to him,
<verse eID="Eph.4.20" />
<verse sID="Eph.4.21" osisID="Eph.4.21" n="21" />and through union with him were taught the truth, as it is to be found in Jesus.
<verse eID="Eph.4.21" />
<verse sID="Eph.4.22" osisID="Eph.4.22" n="22" />For you learned with regard to your former way of living that you must cast off your old nature, which, yielding to deluding passions, grows corrupt;
<verse eID="Eph.4.22" />
<verse sID="Eph.4.23" osisID="Eph.4.23" n="23" />that the spirit of your minds must be constantly renewed;
<verse eID="Eph.4.23" />
<verse sID="Eph.4.24" osisID="Eph.4.24" n="24" />and that you must clothe yourselves in that new nature which was created to resemble God, with the righteousness and holiness springing from the truth.
<verse eID="Eph.4.24" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Eph.4.25" osisID="Eph.4.25" n="25" />Since, therefore, you have cast off what is false, you must every one of you speak the truth to your neighbors. For we are united to one another like the parts of a body.
<verse eID="Eph.4.25" />
<verse sID="Eph.4.26" osisID="Eph.4.26" n="26" />Be angry, yet do not sin. Do not let the sun go down on your anger;
<verse eID="Eph.4.26" />
<verse sID="Eph.4.27" osisID="Eph.4.27" n="27" />and give no opportunity to the devil.
<verse eID="Eph.4.27" />
<verse sID="Eph.4.28" osisID="Eph.4.28" n="28" />Let the person who steals steal no longer, but rather they should toil with their hands at honest work, so that they may have something to share with anyone in need.
<verse eID="Eph.4.28" />
<verse sID="Eph.4.29" osisID="Eph.4.29" n="29" />Never let any foul word pass your lips, but only such good words as the occasion demands, so that they may be a help to those who hear them.
<verse eID="Eph.4.29" />
<verse sID="Eph.4.30" osisID="Eph.4.30" n="30" />And do not grieve God’s Holy Spirit; for it was through that Spirit that God sealed you as his, against the day of redemption.
<verse eID="Eph.4.30" />
<verse sID="Eph.4.31" osisID="Eph.4.31" n="31" />Let all bitterness, passion, anger, brawling, and abusive language be banished from among you, as well as all malice.
<verse eID="Eph.4.31" />
<verse sID="Eph.4.32" osisID="Eph.4.32" n="32" />Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, ready to forgive one another, just as God, in Christ, forgave you.
<verse eID="Eph.4.32" />
<chapter eID="Eph.4" />
<chapter sID="Eph.5" osisID="Eph.5" n="5" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.1" osisID="Eph.5.1" n="1" />Therefore imitate God, as his dear children,
<verse eID="Eph.5.1" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.2" osisID="Eph.5.2" n="2" />and live a life of love, following the example of the Christ, who loved you and gave himself for you as an offering and a sacrifice to God, that should be fragrant and acceptable.
<verse eID="Eph.5.2" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Eph.5.3" osisID="Eph.5.3" n="3" />As for sexual immorality and every kind of impurity, or greed, do not let them even be mentioned among you, as befits Christ’s people,
<verse eID="Eph.5.3" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.4" osisID="Eph.5.4" n="4" />nor shameful conduct, nor foolish talk or jesting, for they are wholly out of place among you; but rather thanksgiving.
<verse eID="Eph.5.4" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.5" osisID="Eph.5.5" n="5" />For of this you may be sure – that no one who is unchaste or impure or greedy of gain (for to be greedy of gain is idolatry) has any place awaiting him in the kingdom of the Christ and God.
<verse eID="Eph.5.5" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Eph.5.6" osisID="Eph.5.6" n="6" />Do not let anyone deceive you with specious arguments. Those are the sins that bring down the wrath of God on the disobedient.
<verse eID="Eph.5.6" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.7" osisID="Eph.5.7" n="7" />Therefore have nothing to do with such people.
<verse eID="Eph.5.7" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.8" osisID="Eph.5.8" n="8" />For, although you were once in darkness, now, by your union with the Lord, you are in the light. Live as children of light –
<verse eID="Eph.5.8" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.9" osisID="Eph.5.9" n="9" />for the outcome of life in the light may be seen in every form of goodness, righteousness, and sincerity –
<verse eID="Eph.5.9" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.10" osisID="Eph.5.10" n="10" />always trying to find out what is pleasing to the Lord.
<verse eID="Eph.5.10" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.11" osisID="Eph.5.11" n="11" />Take no part in deeds of darkness, from which no good can come; on the contrary, expose them.
<verse eID="Eph.5.11" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.12" osisID="Eph.5.12" n="12" />It is degrading even to speak of the things continually done by them in secret.
<verse eID="Eph.5.12" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.13" osisID="Eph.5.13" n="13" />All such actions, when exposed, have their true character made manifest by the light.
<verse eID="Eph.5.13" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.14" osisID="Eph.5.14" n="14" />For everything that has its true character made manifest is clear as light. And that is why it is said –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘Sleeper, awake!</l>
<l level="1">Arise from the dead,</l>
<l level="2">and the Christ will give you light!’ <verse eID="Eph.5.14" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Eph.5.15" osisID="Eph.5.15" n="15" />Take great care, then, how you live – not unwisely but wisely,
<verse eID="Eph.5.15" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.16" osisID="Eph.5.16" n="16" />making the most of every opportunity; for these are evil days.
<verse eID="Eph.5.16" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.17" osisID="Eph.5.17" n="17" />Therefore do not grow thoughtless, but try to understand what the Lord’s will is.
<verse eID="Eph.5.17" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.18" osisID="Eph.5.18" n="18" />Do not drink wine to excess, for that leads to profligacy; but seek to be filled with the Spirit of God, and speak to one another in psalms and hymns and sacred songs.
<verse eID="Eph.5.18" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.19" osisID="Eph.5.19" n="19" />Sing and make music in your hearts to the Lord.
<verse eID="Eph.5.19" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.20" osisID="Eph.5.20" n="20" />Always give thanks for everything to our God and Father, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
<verse eID="Eph.5.20" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Eph.5.21" osisID="Eph.5.21" n="21" />Submit to one another because you honor and respect Christ.
<verse eID="Eph.5.21" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Eph.5.22" osisID="Eph.5.22" n="22" />Wives should submit to their husbands as submitting to the Lord.
<verse eID="Eph.5.22" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.23" osisID="Eph.5.23" n="23" />For a man is the head of his wife, as the Christ is the head of the church – being indeed himself the Savior of his body.
<verse eID="Eph.5.23" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.24" osisID="Eph.5.24" n="24" />But as the church submits to the Christ, so also should wives submit to their husbands in everything.
<verse eID="Eph.5.24" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.25" osisID="Eph.5.25" n="25" />Husbands, love your wives, just as the Christ loved the church, and gave himself for her,
<verse eID="Eph.5.25" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.26" osisID="Eph.5.26" n="26" />to make her holy, after purifying her by the washing with the water, according to his promise;
<verse eID="Eph.5.26" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.27" osisID="Eph.5.27" n="27" />so that he might himself bring the church, in all her beauty, into his own presence, with no spot or wrinkle or blemish of any kind, but that she might be holy and faultless.
<verse eID="Eph.5.27" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.28" osisID="Eph.5.28" n="28" />That is how husbands ought to love their wives – as if they were their own bodies. A man who loves his wife is really loving himself;
<verse eID="Eph.5.28" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.29" osisID="Eph.5.29" n="29" />for no one ever yet hated his own body. But everyone feeds his body and cares for it, just as the Christ for the church;
<verse eID="Eph.5.29" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.30" osisID="Eph.5.30" n="30" />for we are members of his body.
<verse eID="Eph.5.30" />
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">
<verse sID="Eph.5.31" osisID="Eph.5.31" n="31" />For this cause a man will leave his father and mother, and be united to his wife; and the man and his wife will become one. <verse eID="Eph.5.31" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Eph.5.32" osisID="Eph.5.32" n="32" />In this there is a profound truth – I am speaking of Christ and his church.
<verse eID="Eph.5.32" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.33" osisID="Eph.5.33" n="33" />However, for you individually, let each love his wife as if she were himself; and the wife be careful to respect her husband.
<verse eID="Eph.5.33" />
<chapter eID="Eph.5" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Eph.6" osisID="Eph.6" n="6" />
<verse sID="Eph.6.1" osisID="Eph.6.1" n="1" />Children, obey your parents, as children of the Lord; for that is but right.
<verse eID="Eph.6.1" />
<verse sID="Eph.6.2" osisID="Eph.6.2" n="2" />‘Honor your father and mother’ – this is the first Commandment with a promise –
<verse eID="Eph.6.2" />
<verse sID="Eph.6.3" osisID="Eph.6.3" n="3" />‘so that you may prosper and have a long life on earth.’
<verse eID="Eph.6.3" />
<verse sID="Eph.6.4" osisID="Eph.6.4" n="4" />And fathers, do not irritate your children, but bring them up with Christian discipline and instruction.
<verse eID="Eph.6.4" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Eph.6.5" osisID="Eph.6.5" n="5" />Slaves, obey your earthly masters, with anxious care, giving them ungrudging service, as if obeying the Christ;
<verse eID="Eph.6.5" />
<verse sID="Eph.6.6" osisID="Eph.6.6" n="6" />not only when their eyes are on you, as if you had merely to please people, but as slaves of Christ, who are trying to carry out the will of God.
<verse eID="Eph.6.6" />
<verse sID="Eph.6.7" osisID="Eph.6.7" n="7" />Give your service heartily and cheerfully, as working for the Master and not for people;
<verse eID="Eph.6.7" />
<verse sID="Eph.6.8" osisID="Eph.6.8" n="8" />for you know that everyone will be rewarded by the Master for any honest work that he has done, whether he is a slave or free.
<verse eID="Eph.6.8" />
<verse sID="Eph.6.9" osisID="Eph.6.9" n="9" />And masters, treat your slaves in the same spirit. Give up threatening them; for you know that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and that before him there is no distinction of rank.
<verse eID="Eph.6.9" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Eph.6.10" osisID="Eph.6.10" n="10" />For the future, find strength in your union with the Lord, and in the power which comes from his might.
<verse eID="Eph.6.10" />
<verse sID="Eph.6.11" osisID="Eph.6.11" n="11" />Put on the full armor of God, so that you may be able to stand your ground against the stratagems of the devil.
<verse eID="Eph.6.11" />
<verse sID="Eph.6.12" osisID="Eph.6.12" n="12" />For ours is no struggle against enemies of flesh and blood, but against all the various powers of evil that hold sway in the darkness around us, against the spirits of wickedness on high.
<verse eID="Eph.6.12" />
<verse sID="Eph.6.13" osisID="Eph.6.13" n="13" />Therefore take up the full armor of God, so that when the evil day comes, you may be able to withstand the attack, and, having fought to the end, still to stand your ground.
<verse eID="Eph.6.13" />
<verse sID="Eph.6.14" osisID="Eph.6.14" n="14" />Stand your ground, then, with truth for your belt, and with righteousness for your breast-plate,
<verse eID="Eph.6.14" />
<verse sID="Eph.6.15" osisID="Eph.6.15" n="15" />and with the readiness to serve the good news of peace as shoes for your feet.
<verse eID="Eph.6.15" />
<verse sID="Eph.6.16" osisID="Eph.6.16" n="16" />At every onslaught take up faith for your shield; for with it you will be able to extinguish all the flaming darts of the evil one.
<verse eID="Eph.6.16" />
<verse sID="Eph.6.17" osisID="Eph.6.17" n="17" />And receive the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit – which is the message of God – always with prayer and supplication.
<verse eID="Eph.6.17" />
<verse sID="Eph.6.18" osisID="Eph.6.18" n="18" />Pray in spirit at all times. Be intent on this, with unwearying perseverance and supplication for all Christ’s people –
<verse eID="Eph.6.18" />
<verse sID="Eph.6.19" osisID="Eph.6.19" n="19" />and on my behalf also, so that when I begin to speak, words may be given me, so that I may fearlessly make known the inmost truth of the good news,
<verse eID="Eph.6.19" />
<verse sID="Eph.6.20" osisID="Eph.6.20" n="20" />on behalf of which I am an ambassador – in chains! Pray that, in telling it, I may speak fearlessly as I ought.

<verse eID="Phil.1.2" />
<verse sID="Phil.1.3" osisID="Phil.1.3" n="3" />Every recollection that I have of you is a cause of thankfulness to God,
<verse eID="Phil.1.3" />
<verse sID="Phil.1.4" osisID="Phil.1.4" n="4" />always, in every prayer that I offer for you all – my prayers are full of joy –
<verse eID="Phil.1.4" />
<verse sID="Phil.1.5" osisID="Phil.1.5" n="5" />Because of the share that you have had in spreading the good news, from the first day that you received it until now.
<verse eID="Phil.1.5" />
<verse sID="Phil.1.6" osisID="Phil.1.6" n="6" />For of this I am confident, that he who began a good work in you will complete it in readiness for the day of Jesus Christ.
<verse eID="Phil.1.6" />
<verse sID="Phil.1.7" osisID="Phil.1.7" n="7" />And, indeed, I am justified in feeling like this about you all; because you have a warm place in my heart – you who all, both in my imprisonment and in the work of defending and establishing the good news, shared my privilege with me.
<verse eID="Phil.1.7" />
<verse sID="Phil.1.8" osisID="Phil.1.8" n="8" />God will bear me witness how I yearn over you all with the tenderness of Christ Jesus.

<verse sID="Phil.1.14" osisID="Phil.1.14" n="14" />And besides this, most of our fellow followers have gained confidence in the Lord through my chains, and now venture with far greater freedom to speak of God’s message fearlessly.
<verse eID="Phil.1.14" />
<verse sID="Phil.1.15" osisID="Phil.1.15" n="15" />It is true that some do proclaim the Christ out of Jealousy and opposition; but there are others who proclaim him from goodwill.
<verse eID="Phil.1.15" />
<verse sID="Phil.1.16" osisID="Phil.1.16" n="16" />The latter do it from love for me, knowing that I have been appointed to plead the cause of the good news.
<verse eID="Phil.1.16" />
<verse sID="Phil.1.17" osisID="Phil.1.17" n="17" />The former spread the news of the Christ in a factious spirit, and not sincerely, thinking to add to the pain of my chains.
<verse eID="Phil.1.17" />
<verse sID="Phil.1.18" osisID="Phil.1.18" n="18" />But what of that? Only that in some way or other, either with assumed or with real earnestness, Christ is being made known; and at that I rejoice.
<verse eID="Phil.1.18" />
<verse sID="Phil.1.19" osisID="Phil.1.19" n="19" />Yes, and I will rejoice, for I know that, through your prayers and through a rich supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, all this will make for my salvation.
<verse eID="Phil.1.19" />
<verse sID="Phil.1.20" osisID="Phil.1.20" n="20" />And this will fulfill my earnest expectation and hope that I will have no cause for shame, but that, with unfailing courage, now as hitherto, Christ will be honored in my body, whether by my life or by my death,
<verse eID="Phil.1.20" />
<verse sID="Phil.1.21" osisID="Phil.1.21" n="21" />for to me life is Christ, and death is gain.
<verse eID="Phil.1.21" />
<verse sID="Phil.1.22" osisID="Phil.1.22" n="22" />But what if the life here in the body – if this brings me fruit from my labors? Then which to choose I cannot tell! I am sorely perplexed either way!
<verse eID="Phil.1.22" />
<verse sID="Phil.1.23" osisID="Phil.1.23" n="23" />My own desire is to depart and be with Christ, for this would be far better.
<verse eID="Phil.1.23" />
<verse sID="Phil.1.24" osisID="Phil.1.24" n="24" />But, for your sakes, it may be more needful that I should still remain here in the body.
<verse eID="Phil.1.24" />
<verse sID="Phil.1.25" osisID="Phil.1.25" n="25" />Yes, I am confident that this is so, and therefore I am sure that I will stay, and stay near you all, to promote your progress and joy in the faith;
<verse eID="Phil.1.25" />
<verse sID="Phil.1.26" osisID="Phil.1.26" n="26" />so that, when you once more have me among you, you, in your union with Christ Jesus, may find in me fresh cause for exultation.
<verse eID="Phil.1.26" />
<verse sID="Phil.1.27" osisID="Phil.1.27" n="27" />Under all circumstances let your lives be worthy of the good news of the Christ: so that, whether I come and see you, or whether I hear of your affairs at a distance, I may know that you are standing firm, animated by one spirit, and joining with one heart in a common struggle for the faith taught by the good news,
<verse eID="Phil.1.27" />
<verse sID="Phil.1.28" osisID="Phil.1.28" n="28" />without ever shrinking from your opponents. To them this will be a sign of their destruction and of your salvation – a sign from God.
<verse eID="Phil.1.28" />
<verse sID="Phil.1.29" osisID="Phil.1.29" n="29" />For, on behalf of Christ, you have had the privilege granted you, not only of trusting in him, but also of suffering on his behalf.
<verse eID="Phil.1.29" />
<verse sID="Phil.1.30" osisID="Phil.1.30" n="30" />You will be engaged in the same hard struggle as that which you once saw me waging, and which you hear that I am waging still.
<verse eID="Phil.1.30" />
<chapter eID="Phil.1" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Phil.2" osisID="Phil.2" n="2" />
<verse sID="Phil.2.1" osisID="Phil.2.1" n="1" />If, then, any encouragement comes through union with Christ, if there is any persuasive power in love, if there is any communion with the Spirit, if there is any tenderness or pity,
<verse eID="Phil.2.1" />
<verse sID="Phil.2.2" osisID="Phil.2.2" n="2" />I entreat you to make my happiness complete – Live together animated by the same spirit and in mutual love, one in heart, animated by one Spirit.
<verse eID="Phil.2.2" />
<verse sID="Phil.2.3" osisID="Phil.2.3" n="3" />Nothing should be done out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility lift others up above yourselves,
<verse eID="Phil.2.3" />
<verse sID="Phil.2.4" osisID="Phil.2.4" n="4" />considering not only your own interests but also the interests of others.
<verse eID="Phil.2.4" />
<verse sID="Phil.2.5" osisID="Phil.2.5" n="5" />Let the spirit of Christ Jesus be yours also.
<verse eID="Phil.2.5" />
<verse sID="Phil.2.6" osisID="Phil.2.6" n="6" />Though the divine nature was his from the beginning, yet he did not look on equality with God as above all things to be clung to,
<verse eID="Phil.2.6" />
<verse sID="Phil.2.7" osisID="Phil.2.7" n="7" />but impoverished himself by taking the nature of a servant and becoming like one of us;
<verse eID="Phil.2.7" />
<verse sID="Phil.2.8" osisID="Phil.2.8" n="8" />he appeared among us as a man, and still further humbled himself by submitting even to death – to death on a cross!
<verse eID="Phil.2.8" />
<verse sID="Phil.2.9" osisID="Phil.2.9" n="9" />And that is why God raised him to the very highest place, and gave him the name which stands above all other names,
<verse eID="Phil.2.9" />
<verse sID="Phil.2.10" osisID="Phil.2.10" n="10" />so that in adoration of the name of Jesus every knee should bend, in heaven, on earth, and under the earth,
<verse eID="Phil.2.10" />
<verse sID="Phil.2.11" osisID="Phil.2.11" n="11" />and that every tongue should acknowledge JESUS CHRIST as LORD – to the glory of God the Father.
<verse eID="Phil.2.11" />
<verse sID="Phil.2.12" osisID="Phil.2.12" n="12" />Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always been obedient in the past, so now work out your own salvation with anxious care, not only when I am with you, but all the more now that I am absent.
<verse eID="Phil.2.12" />
<verse sID="Phil.2.13" osisID="Phil.2.13" n="13" />Remember it is God who, in his kindness, is at work within you, enabling you both to will and to work.
<verse eID="Phil.2.13" />
<verse sID="Phil.2.14" osisID="Phil.2.14" n="14" />In all that you do, avoid murmuring and dissension,
<verse eID="Phil.2.14" />
<verse sID="Phil.2.15" osisID="Phil.2.15" n="15" />so as to prove yourselves blameless and innocent – faultless children of God, in the midst of an evil-disposed and perverse generation, in which you are seen shining like stars in a dark world,
<verse eID="Phil.2.15" />
<verse sID="Phil.2.16" osisID="Phil.2.16" n="16" />offering to them the message of life; and then I will be able at the day of Christ to boast that I did not run my course for nothing, or toil for nothing.
<verse eID="Phil.2.16" />
<verse sID="Phil.2.17" osisID="Phil.2.17" n="17" />And yet, even if, when your faith is offered as a sacrifice to God, my lifeblood must be poured out in addition, still I will rejoice and share the joy of you all;
<verse eID="Phil.2.17" />
<verse sID="Phil.2.18" osisID="Phil.2.18" n="18" />and you must also rejoice and share my joy.
<verse eID="Phil.2.18" />
<verse sID="Phil.2.19" osisID="Phil.2.19" n="19" />I hope, however, as one who trusts in the Lord Jesus, to send Timothy to you before long, so that I may myself be cheered by receiving news of you.
<verse eID="Phil.2.19" />
<verse sID="Phil.2.20" osisID="Phil.2.20" n="20" />For I have no one but him to send – no one of kindred spirit who would take the same genuine interest in your welfare.
<verse eID="Phil.2.20" />
<verse sID="Phil.2.21" osisID="Phil.2.21" n="21" />They are all pursuing their own aims and not those of Christ Jesus.
<verse eID="Phil.2.21" />
<verse sID="Phil.2.22" osisID="Phil.2.22" n="22" />But you know what Timothy has proved himself to be, and how, like a child working for his father, he worked hard with me in spreading the good news.
<verse eID="Phil.2.22" />
<verse sID="Phil.2.23" osisID="Phil.2.23" n="23" />It is Timothy, then, whom I hope to send, as soon as ever I can foresee how it will go with me.
<verse eID="Phil.2.23" />
<verse sID="Phil.2.24" osisID="Phil.2.24" n="24" />And I am confident, as one who trusts in the Lord Jesus, that before long I myself will follow.
<verse eID="Phil.2.24" />
<verse sID="Phil.2.25" osisID="Phil.2.25" n="25" />Still I think it necessary to send Epaphroditus to you now, for he is my dear friend, fellow worker, and fellow soldier, and he was also your messenger to help me in my need.
<verse eID="Phil.2.25" />
<verse sID="Phil.2.26" osisID="Phil.2.26" n="26" />For he has been longing to see you all, and has been distressed because you heard of his illness.
<verse eID="Phil.2.26" />
<verse sID="Phil.2.27" osisID="Phil.2.27" n="27" />And I can assure you that his illness very nearly proved fatal. But God had pity on him, and not on him only but also on me, so that I might not have sorrow on sorrow.
<verse eID="Phil.2.27" />
<verse sID="Phil.2.28" osisID="Phil.2.28" n="28" />I am all the more ready, therefore, to send him, so that the sight of him may revive your spirits and my own sorrow be lightened.
<verse eID="Phil.2.28" />
<verse sID="Phil.2.29" osisID="Phil.2.29" n="29" />Give him, then, the heartiest of Christian welcomes, and hold such people in great honor.
<verse eID="Phil.2.29" />
<verse sID="Phil.2.30" osisID="Phil.2.30" n="30" />For it was owing to his devotion to the Master’s work that he was at the point of death, having risked his own life in the effort to supply what was wanting in the help that you sent me.
<verse eID="Phil.2.30" />
<chapter eID="Phil.2" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Phil.3" osisID="Phil.3" n="3" />
<verse sID="Phil.3.1" osisID="Phil.3.1" n="1" />In conclusion, my friends, all joy be yours in your union with the Lord. To repeat what I have already written does not weary me, and is the safe course for you.
<verse eID="Phil.3.1" />
<verse sID="Phil.3.2" osisID="Phil.3.2" n="2" />Beware of those dogs! Beware of those mischievous workers! Beware of the men who mutilate themselves!
<verse eID="Phil.3.2" />
<verse sID="Phil.3.3" osisID="Phil.3.3" n="3" />For it is we who are the circumcised – we whose worship is prompted by the Spirit of God, who exult in Christ Jesus, and who do not rely on external privileges;
<verse eID="Phil.3.3" />
<verse sID="Phil.3.4" osisID="Phil.3.4" n="4" />though I, if anyone, have cause to rely even on them. If anyone thinks he can rely on external privileges, far more can I!
<verse eID="Phil.3.4" />
<verse sID="Phil.3.5" osisID="Phil.3.5" n="5" />I was circumcised when eight days old; I am an Israelite by birth, and of the tribe of Benjamin; I am a Hebrew, and the child of Hebrews. As to the Law, I was a Pharisee;
<verse eID="Phil.3.5" />
<verse sID="Phil.3.6" osisID="Phil.3.6" n="6" />as to zeal, I was a persecutor of the church; as to such righteousness as is due to Law, I proved myself blameless.
<verse eID="Phil.3.6" />
<verse sID="Phil.3.7" osisID="Phil.3.7" n="7" />But all the things which I once held to be gains I have now, for the Christ’s sake, come to count as loss.
<verse eID="Phil.3.7" />
<verse sID="Phil.3.8" osisID="Phil.3.8" n="8" />More than that, I count everything as loss, for the sake of the exceeding value of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord. And for his sake I have lost everything, and count it as refuse, if I may but gain Christ and be found in union with him;
<verse eID="Phil.3.8" />
<verse sID="Phil.3.9" osisID="Phil.3.9" n="9" />any righteousness that I have being, not the righteousness that results from Law, but the righteousness which comes through faith in Christ – the righteousness which is derived from God and is founded on faith.
<verse eID="Phil.3.9" />
<verse sID="Phil.3.10" osisID="Phil.3.10" n="10" />Then indeed I will know Christ, and the power of his resurrection, and all that it means to share his sufferings,
<verse eID="Phil.3.10" />
<verse sID="Phil.3.11" osisID="Phil.3.11" n="11" />in the hope that, if I become like him in death, I may possibly attain to the resurrection from the dead.
<verse eID="Phil.3.11" />
<verse sID="Phil.3.12" osisID="Phil.3.12" n="12" />Not that I have already laid hold of it, or that I am already made perfect. But I press on, in the hope of actually laying hold of that for which indeed I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus.
<verse eID="Phil.3.12" />
<verse sID="Phil.3.13" osisID="Phil.3.13" n="13" />For I, friends, do not regard myself as having yet laid hold of it. But this one thing I do – forgetting what lies behind, and straining every nerve for that which lies in front,
<verse eID="Phil.3.13" />
<verse sID="Phil.3.14" osisID="Phil.3.14" n="14" />I press on to the goal, to gain the prize of that heavenward call which God gave me through Christ Jesus.
<verse eID="Phil.3.14" />
<verse sID="Phil.3.15" osisID="Phil.3.15" n="15" />Let all of us, then, whose faith is mature, think this way. Then, if on any matter you think otherwise, God will make that also plain to you.
<verse eID="Phil.3.15" />
<verse sID="Phil.3.16" osisID="Phil.3.16" n="16" />Only we are bound to order our lives by what we have already attained.
<verse eID="Phil.3.16" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Phil.3.17" osisID="Phil.3.17" n="17" />My friends, unite in following my example, and fix your eyes on those who are living by the pattern which we have set you.
<verse eID="Phil.3.17" />
<verse sID="Phil.3.18" osisID="Phil.3.18" n="18" />For there are many – of whom I have often told you, and now tell you even with tears – who are living in enmity to the cross of the Christ.
<verse eID="Phil.3.18" />
<verse sID="Phil.3.19" osisID="Phil.3.19" n="19" />The end of such people is ruin; for their appetites are their God, and they glory in their shame; their minds are given up to earthly things.
<verse eID="Phil.3.19" />
<verse sID="Phil.3.20" osisID="Phil.3.20" n="20" />But we are citizens of heaven, and from heaven we expect a savior to come, the Lord Jesus Christ.
<verse eID="Phil.3.20" />
<verse sID="Phil.3.21" osisID="Phil.3.21" n="21" />By the exercise of his power to bring everything into subjection to himself, he will make our humble bodies like his glorious body.
<verse eID="Phil.3.21" />
<chapter eID="Phil.3" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Phil.4" osisID="Phil.4" n="4" />
<verse sID="Phil.4.1" osisID="Phil.4.1" n="1" />So then, my dear friends, whom I am longing to see – you who are my joy and my crown, stand fast in union with the Lord, dear friends.
<verse eID="Phil.4.1" />
<verse sID="Phil.4.2" osisID="Phil.4.2" n="2" />I entreat Euodia, and I entreat Syntyche, to live in harmony, in union with the Lord;
<verse eID="Phil.4.2" />
<verse sID="Phil.4.3" osisID="Phil.4.3" n="3" />yes, and I ask you, my true comrade, to help them, remembering that they toiled by my side in spreading the good news; and so, too, did Clement and my other fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life.
<verse eID="Phil.4.3" />
<verse sID="Phil.4.4" osisID="Phil.4.4" n="4" />All joy be yours at all times in your union with the Lord. Again I repeat – All joy be yours.
<verse eID="Phil.4.4" />
<verse sID="Phil.4.5" osisID="Phil.4.5" n="5" />Let your forbearing spirit be plain to everyone. The Lord is near.
<verse eID="Phil.4.5" />
<verse sID="Phil.4.6" osisID="Phil.4.6" n="6" />Do not be anxious about anything; but under all circumstances, by prayer and entreaty joined with thanksgiving, make your needs known to God.
<verse eID="Phil.4.6" />
<verse sID="Phil.4.7" osisID="Phil.4.7" n="7" />Then the peace of God, which is beyond all human understanding, will stand guard over your hearts and thoughts, through your union with Christ Jesus.
<verse eID="Phil.4.7" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Phil.4.8" osisID="Phil.4.8" n="8" />In conclusion, friends, whenever you find things that are true or honorable, righteous or pure, lovable or praiseworthy, or if virtue and honor have any meaning, let them fill your thoughts.
<verse eID="Phil.4.8" />
<verse sID="Phil.4.9" osisID="Phil.4.9" n="9" />All that you learned and received and heard and saw in me put into practice continually; and then God, the giver of peace, will be with you.
<verse eID="Phil.4.9" />
<verse sID="Phil.4.10" osisID="Phil.4.10" n="10" />It was a matter of great joy to me, as one in union with the Lord, that at length your interest in me had revived. The interest indeed you had, but not the opportunity.
<verse eID="Phil.4.10" />
<verse sID="Phil.4.11" osisID="Phil.4.11" n="11" />Do not think that I am saying this under the pressure of want. For I, however I am placed, have learned to be independent of circumstances.
<verse eID="Phil.4.11" />
<verse sID="Phil.4.12" osisID="Phil.4.12" n="12" />I know how to face humble circumstances, and I know how to face prosperity. Into all and every human experience I have been initiated – into plenty and hunger, into prosperity and want.
<verse eID="Phil.4.12" />
<verse sID="Phil.4.13" osisID="Phil.4.13" n="13" />I can do everything in the strength of him who makes me strong!
<verse eID="Phil.4.13" />
<verse sID="Phil.4.14" osisID="Phil.4.14" n="14" />Yet you have acted nobly in sharing my troubles.
<verse eID="Phil.4.14" />
<verse sID="Phil.4.15" osisID="Phil.4.15" n="15" />And you at Philippi know, as well as I, that in the early days of the good news – at the time when I had just left Macedonia – no church, with the one exception of yourselves, had anything to do with me as far as giving and receiving are concerned.
<verse eID="Phil.4.15" />
<verse sID="Phil.4.16" osisID="Phil.4.16" n="16" />Indeed, even while I was still in Thessalonica, you sent more than once to relieve my wants.
<verse eID="Phil.4.16" />
<verse sID="Phil.4.17" osisID="Phil.4.17" n="17" />It is not that I am anxious for your gifts, but I am anxious to see the abundant return that will be placed to your account. I have enough of everything, and to spare.
<verse eID="Phil.4.17" />
<verse sID="Phil.4.18" osisID="Phil.4.18" n="18" />My wants are fully satisfied, now that I have received from Epaphroditus the gifts which you sent me – the sweet fragrance of a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God.
<verse eID="Phil.4.18" />
<verse sID="Phil.4.19" osisID="Phil.4.19" n="19" />And my God, out of the greatness of his wealth, will, in glory, fully satisfy your every need, through your union with Christ Jesus.
<verse eID="Phil.4.19" />
<verse sID="Phil.4.20" osisID="Phil.4.20" n="20" />To him, our God and Father, be ascribed all glory for every and ever. Amen.
<verse eID="Phil.4.20" />
<verse sID="Phil.4.21" osisID="Phil.4.21" n="21" />Give my greeting to everyone of the people of Christ Jesus. The Lord’s followers who are with me send your their greetings.
<verse eID="Phil.4.21" />
<verse sID="Phil.4.22" osisID="Phil.4.22" n="22" />All Christ’s people here, and especially those who belong to the Emperor’s household, send theirs.
<verse eID="Phil.4.22" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Phil.4.23" osisID="Phil.4.23" n="23" />May the blessing of the Lord Jesus Christ rest on your souls.

<verse eID="Col.1.1" />
<verse sID="Col.1.2" osisID="Col.1.2" n="2" />To Christ’s people at Colossae – the followers who are faithful to him: May God, our Father, bless you and give you peace.
<verse eID="Col.1.2" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Col.1.3" osisID="Col.1.3" n="3" />Whenever we pray we never fail to thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, for you,
<verse eID="Col.1.3" />
<verse sID="Col.1.4" osisID="Col.1.4" n="4" />now that we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love that you have for all his people,
<verse eID="Col.1.4" />
<verse sID="Col.1.5" osisID="Col.1.5" n="5" />because of the hope which is kept safe for you in heaven. Of this hope you heard long ago in the true message of the good news which reached you,
<verse eID="Col.1.5" />
<verse sID="Col.1.6" osisID="Col.1.6" n="6" />bearing fruit and growing, as it does, through all the world, just as it did among you from the very day that you heard of God’s loving kindness, and understood what that loving kindness really is.
<verse eID="Col.1.6" />
<verse sID="Col.1.7" osisID="Col.1.7" n="7" />It is just what you learned from Epaphras, our dear fellow servant, who, as a minister of the Christ, faithfully represents us,
<verse eID="Col.1.7" />
<verse sID="Col.1.8" osisID="Col.1.8" n="8" />and who told us of the love with which the Spirit has inspired you.

<p>
<verse sID="Col.1.9" osisID="Col.1.9" n="9" />And therefore we, from the very day that we heard this, have never ceased praying for you, or asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of the will of God, which comes through all true spiritual wisdom and insight.
<verse eID="Col.1.9" />
<verse sID="Col.1.10" osisID="Col.1.10" n="10" />Then you will live lives worthy of the Master, and so please God in every way. Your lives will be fruitful in every kind of good action, and grow into a fuller knowledge of God;
<verse eID="Col.1.10" />
<verse sID="Col.1.11" osisID="Col.1.11" n="11" />you will be made strong at all points with a strength worthy of the power manifested in his glory – strong to endure with patience, and even with gladness, whatever may happen to you;
<verse eID="Col.1.11" />
<verse sID="Col.1.12" osisID="Col.1.12" n="12" />and you will give thanks to the Father who made you fit to share the lot which awaits Christ’s people in the realms of light.

<verse sID="Col.1.14" osisID="Col.1.14" n="14" />and through whom we have found deliverance in the forgiveness of our sins.
<verse eID="Col.1.14" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Col.1.15" osisID="Col.1.15" n="15" />For Christ is the incarnation of the invisible God – first-born and head of all creation;
<verse eID="Col.1.15" />
<verse sID="Col.1.16" osisID="Col.1.16" n="16" />for in him was created all that is in heaven and on earth, the visible and the invisible – angels and archangels and all the powers of heaven.
<verse eID="Col.1.16" />
<verse sID="Col.1.17" osisID="Col.1.17" n="17" />All has been created through him and for him. He was before all things, and all things unite in him;
<verse eID="Col.1.17" />
<verse sID="Col.1.18" osisID="Col.1.18" n="18" />and he is the head of the church, which is his body. The first-born from the dead, he is to the church the Source of its life, that he, in all things, may stand first.
<verse eID="Col.1.18" />
<verse sID="Col.1.19" osisID="Col.1.19" n="19" />For it pleased the Father that in him the divine nature in all its fulness should live,
<verse eID="Col.1.19" />
<verse sID="Col.1.20" osisID="Col.1.20" n="20" />and through him to reconcile all things to himself (making peace by the shedding of Christ’s blood offered on the cross) – whether on earth or in heaven.
<verse eID="Col.1.20" />
<verse sID="Col.1.21" osisID="Col.1.21" n="21" />And it pleased God that you, once estranged from him and hostile towards him in your thoughts, intent only on wickedness –
<verse eID="Col.1.21" />
<verse sID="Col.1.22" osisID="Col.1.22" n="22" />But now he has reconciled you to himself by the sacrifice of Christ’s earthly body in death – it has pleased God that you should stand in his presence holy, pure, and blameless,
<verse eID="Col.1.22" />
<verse sID="Col.1.23" osisID="Col.1.23" n="23" />if only you remain true to your faith, firm and immovable, never abandoning the hope held out in the good news to which you listened, which has been proclaimed among all created things under heaven, and of which I, Paul, was made an assistant.
<verse eID="Col.1.23" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Col.1.24" osisID="Col.1.24" n="24" />Now at last I can rejoice in my sufferings on your behalf, and in my own person I supplement the afflictions endured by the Christ, for the sake of his body, the church;
<verse eID="Col.1.24" />
<verse sID="Col.1.25" osisID="Col.1.25" n="25" />of which I myself became a minister in virtue of the office with which God entrusted me for your benefit, to declare the message of God in all its fulness –
<verse eID="Col.1.25" />
<verse sID="Col.1.26" osisID="Col.1.26" n="26" />That truth which has been hidden from former ages and generations. But now it has been revealed to God’s people,
<verse eID="Col.1.26" />
<verse sID="Col.1.27" osisID="Col.1.27" n="27" />to whom it was his pleasure to make known the surpassing glory of that hidden truth when proclaimed among the Gentiles – ‘Christ among you! Your hope of glory!’
<verse eID="Col.1.27" />
<verse sID="Col.1.28" osisID="Col.1.28" n="28" />This is the Christ whom we proclaim, warning everyone, and instructing everyone, with all the wisdom that we possess, in the hope of bringing everyone into God’s presence perfected by union with Christ.
<verse eID="Col.1.28" />
<verse sID="Col.1.29" osisID="Col.1.29" n="29" />It is for that I toil, struggling with all the energy which he inspires and which works powerfully within me.
<verse eID="Col.1.29" />
<chapter eID="Col.1" />
<chapter sID="Col.2" osisID="Col.2" n="2" />
<verse sID="Col.2.1" osisID="Col.2.1" n="1" />I want you to know in how great a struggle I am engaged for you and for Christ’s people at Laodicea, and for all who have not yet seen me;
<verse eID="Col.2.1" />
<verse sID="Col.2.2" osisID="Col.2.2" n="2" />in the hope that they, being bound to one another by love, and keeping in view the full blessedness of a firm conviction, may be encouraged to strive for a perfect knowledge of God’s hidden truth,
<verse eID="Col.2.2" />
<verse sID="Col.2.3" osisID="Col.2.3" n="3" />even Christ himself, in whom all treasures of wisdom and knowledge lie hidden.
<verse eID="Col.2.3" />
<verse sID="Col.2.4" osisID="Col.2.4" n="4" />I say this to prevent anyone from deceiving you by plausible arguments.
<verse eID="Col.2.4" />
<verse sID="Col.2.5" osisID="Col.2.5" n="5" />It is true that I am not with you in person, but I am with you in spirit, and am glad to see the good order and the unbroken front resulting from your faith in Christ.
<verse eID="Col.2.5" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Col.2.6" osisID="Col.2.6" n="6" />Since, therefore, you have received Jesus, the Christ, as your Lord, live your lives in union with him –
<verse eID="Col.2.6" />
<verse sID="Col.2.7" osisID="Col.2.7" n="7" />rooted in him, building up your characters through union with him, growing stronger through your faith, as you were taught, overflowing with faith and thanksgiving.
<verse eID="Col.2.7" />
<verse sID="Col.2.8" osisID="Col.2.8" n="8" />Take care there is not someone who will carry you away by his ‘philosophy’ – a hollow sham! – following, as it does, mere human traditions, and dealing with puerile questions of this world, and not with Christ.
<verse eID="Col.2.8" />
<verse sID="Col.2.9" osisID="Col.2.9" n="9" />For in Christ the Godhead in all its fulness dwells incarnate;
<verse eID="Col.2.9" />
<verse sID="Col.2.10" osisID="Col.2.10" n="10" />and, by your union with him, you also are filled with it. He is the head of all archangels and powers of heaven.
<verse eID="Col.2.10" />
<verse sID="Col.2.11" osisID="Col.2.11" n="11" />By your union with him you received a circumcision that was not performed by human hands, when you threw off the tyranny of the earthly body, and received the circumcision of the Christ.
<verse eID="Col.2.11" />
<verse sID="Col.2.12" osisID="Col.2.12" n="12" />For in baptism you were buried with Christ; and in baptism you were also raised to life with him, through your faith in the omnipotence of God, who raised him from the dead.
<verse eID="Col.2.12" />
<verse sID="Col.2.13" osisID="Col.2.13" n="13" />And to you, who once were dead, by reason of your sins and your uncircumcised nature – to you God gave life in giving life to Christ! He pardoned all our sins!
<verse eID="Col.2.13" />
<verse sID="Col.2.14" osisID="Col.2.14" n="14" />He canceled the bond which stood against us – the bond that consisted of ordinances – and which was directly hostile to us! He has taken it out of our way by nailing it to the cross!
<verse eID="Col.2.14" />
<verse sID="Col.2.15" osisID="Col.2.15" n="15" />He rid himself of all the powers of evil, and held them up to open contempt, when he celebrated his triumph over them on the cross!
<verse eID="Col.2.15" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Col.2.16" osisID="Col.2.16" n="16" />Do not, then, allow anyone to take you to task on questions of eating or drinking, or in the matter of annual or monthly or weekly festivals.
<verse eID="Col.2.16" />
<verse sID="Col.2.17" osisID="Col.2.17" n="17" />These things are only the shadow of what is to come; the substance is in the Christ.
<verse eID="Col.2.17" />
<verse sID="Col.2.18" osisID="Col.2.18" n="18" />Do not let anyone defraud you of the reality by affecting delight in so-called ‘humility’ and angel-worship. Such a person busies themselves with their visions, and without reason are rendered conceited by their merely human intellect.
<verse eID="Col.2.18" />
<verse sID="Col.2.19" osisID="Col.2.19" n="19" />They fail to maintain union with the head, to whom it is due that the whole body, nourished and knit together by the contact and connexion of every part, grows with a divine growth.
<verse eID="Col.2.19" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Col.2.20" osisID="Col.2.20" n="20" />Since, with Christ, you became dead to the puerile teaching of this world, why do you submit, as if you still belonged to the world,
<verse eID="Col.2.20" />
<verse sID="Col.2.21" osisID="Col.2.21" n="21" />to such ordinances as ‘Do not handle, or taste, or touch’?
<verse eID="Col.2.21" />
<verse sID="Col.2.22" osisID="Col.2.22" n="22" />For all the things referred to in them cease to exist when used. You are following mere human directions and instructions.
<verse eID="Col.2.22" />
<verse sID="Col.2.23" osisID="Col.2.23" n="23" />Such prohibitions appear reasonable where there is a desire for self-imposed service, and so-called ‘humility,’ and harsh treatment of the body, but are of no real value against the indulgence of our earthly nature.
<verse eID="Col.2.23" />
<chapter eID="Col.2" />
<chapter sID="Col.3" osisID="Col.3" n="3" />
<verse sID="Col.3.1" osisID="Col.3.1" n="1" />Since, therefore, you were raised to life with the Christ, seek for the things that are above; for it is there that the Christ is seated at the right hand of God.
<verse eID="Col.3.1" />
<verse sID="Col.3.2" osisID="Col.3.2" n="2" />Fix your thoughts on the things that are above, not on those that are on earth.
<verse eID="Col.3.2" />
<verse sID="Col.3.3" osisID="Col.3.3" n="3" />For you died, and your life now lies hidden, with the Christ, in God.
<verse eID="Col.3.3" />
<verse sID="Col.3.4" osisID="Col.3.4" n="4" />When the Christ, who is our life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.

<verse eID="Col.3.4" />
<!-- s --><title>The Gospel in the Daily Life</title>
<p>
<verse sID="Col.3.5" osisID="Col.3.5" n="5" />Therefore destroy all that is earthly in you – immorality, uncleanness, passions, evil desires, and that greed which is idolatry.
<verse eID="Col.3.5" />
<verse sID="Col.3.6" osisID="Col.3.6" n="6" />These are the things because of which the wrath of God comes,
<verse eID="Col.3.6" />
<verse sID="Col.3.7" osisID="Col.3.7" n="7" />and to which you, like others, once devoted your lives, when you lived for them.
<verse eID="Col.3.7" />
<verse sID="Col.3.8" osisID="Col.3.8" n="8" />You, however, must now lay aside all such things – anger, passion, malice, slander, abuse.
<verse eID="Col.3.8" />
<verse sID="Col.3.9" osisID="Col.3.9" n="9" />Never lie to one another. Get rid of your old self and its habits,
<verse eID="Col.3.9" />
<verse sID="Col.3.10" osisID="Col.3.10" n="10" />and clothe yourselves with that new self, which, as it gains in knowledge, is being constantly renewed in resemblance to him who made it.
<verse eID="Col.3.10" />
<verse sID="Col.3.11" osisID="Col.3.11" n="11" />In that new life there is no distinction between Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free; but Christ is all! – and in all!
<verse eID="Col.3.11" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Col.3.12" osisID="Col.3.12" n="12" />Therefore, as God’s people, consecrated and dear to him, clothe yourselves with tenderness of heart, kindliness, humility, gentleness, forbearance;
<verse eID="Col.3.12" />
<verse sID="Col.3.13" osisID="Col.3.13" n="13" />bearing with one another, and, when there is any ground for complaint, forgiving one another freely. As the Master freely forgave you, so you must forgive one another.
<verse eID="Col.3.13" />
<verse sID="Col.3.14" osisID="Col.3.14" n="14" />Over all these virtues put on love; for that is the belt which makes all complete.
<verse eID="Col.3.14" />
<verse sID="Col.3.15" osisID="Col.3.15" n="15" />Let the peace that the Christ gives decide all doubts within your hearts; for you also were called to the enjoyment of peace as members of one body. And show yourselves thankful.
<verse eID="Col.3.15" />
<verse sID="Col.3.16" osisID="Col.3.16" n="16" />Let the message of the Christ be alive in your minds in all its wealth, bringing all wisdom with it. Teach and admonish one another with psalms, and hymns, and sacred songs, full of the loving kindness of God, lifting your hearts in song to him.
<verse eID="Col.3.16" />
<verse sID="Col.3.17" osisID="Col.3.17" n="17" />And, whatever you say or do, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus; and through him offer thanksgiving to God the father.
<verse eID="Col.3.17" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Col.3.18" osisID="Col.3.18" n="18" />Wives, submit to your husbands, as befits those who belong to the Lord.
<verse eID="Col.3.18" />
<verse sID="Col.3.19" osisID="Col.3.19" n="19" />Husbands, love your wives, and never treat them harshly.
<verse eID="Col.3.19" />
<verse sID="Col.3.20" osisID="Col.3.20" n="20" />Children, always obey your parents; for that is pleasant to see in those who belong to the Lord.
<verse eID="Col.3.20" />
<verse sID="Col.3.21" osisID="Col.3.21" n="21" />Fathers, never irritate your children, otherwise they might become disheartened.
<verse eID="Col.3.21" />
<verse sID="Col.3.22" osisID="Col.3.22" n="22" />Slaves, always obey your earthly masters, not only when their eyes are on you, as if you had but to please people alone, but giving them ungrudging service, in your respect for the Master.
<verse eID="Col.3.22" />
<verse sID="Col.3.23" osisID="Col.3.23" n="23" />Whatever you do, do it with all your heart, as if working for the Master and not for people,
<verse eID="Col.3.23" />
<verse sID="Col.3.24" osisID="Col.3.24" n="24" />since you know that it is from the Master that you will receive the inheritance which will be your reward. You are serving Christ, the Master.
<verse eID="Col.3.24" />
<verse sID="Col.3.25" osisID="Col.3.25" n="25" />Those who do wrong will reap the wrong they have done; and there will be no partiality.
<verse eID="Col.3.25" />
<chapter eID="Col.3" />
<chapter sID="Col.4" osisID="Col.4" n="4" />
<verse sID="Col.4.1" osisID="Col.4.1" n="1" />Masters, do what is right and fair by your slaves, for you know that you also have a Master – in heaven.
<verse eID="Col.4.1" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Col.4.2" osisID="Col.4.2" n="2" />Devote yourselves to prayer. Give your whole mind to it, and also offer thanksgiving;
<verse eID="Col.4.2" />
<verse sID="Col.4.3" osisID="Col.4.3" n="3" />and at the same time pray for us, so that God may give us an opening for our message, so that we may speak of the truths hidden in the Christ – the truths for which I am in chains!
<verse eID="Col.4.3" />
<verse sID="Col.4.4" osisID="Col.4.4" n="4" />Then I will make them known, as I ought to do.
<verse eID="Col.4.4" />
<verse sID="Col.4.5" osisID="Col.4.5" n="5" />Show tact in your behavior to the outside world, making the most of every opportunity.
<verse eID="Col.4.5" />
<verse sID="Col.4.6" osisID="Col.4.6" n="6" />Let your conversation always be kindly, but not bland, season it, as it were, with salt; be aware in each case of the answer you should be giving.

<!-- s --><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>
<verse sID="Col.4.7" osisID="Col.4.7" n="7" />Our dear friend, Tychicus, will tell you all about me. He is a faithful minister, and a fellow servant in the Master’s cause.
<verse eID="Col.4.7" />
<verse sID="Col.4.8" osisID="Col.4.8" n="8" />I send him to you expressly that you may learn our circumstances, and that he may give you encouragement.
<verse eID="Col.4.8" />
<verse sID="Col.4.9" osisID="Col.4.9" n="9" />With him will be Onesimus, our dear faithful friend, who is one of yourselves. They will tell you all that is going on here.
<verse eID="Col.4.9" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Col.4.10" osisID="Col.4.10" n="10" />My fellow prisoner, Aristarchus, sends you his greeting, and Barnabas’s cousin, Mark, sends his. (You have received directions about him. If he comes to you, make him welcome.)
<verse eID="Col.4.10" />
<verse sID="Col.4.11" osisID="Col.4.11" n="11" />Joshua, who is called Justus, also sends his greeting. These are the only converts from Judaism who have worked with me for the kingdom of God; I have found them a great comfort.
<verse eID="Col.4.11" />
<verse sID="Col.4.12" osisID="Col.4.12" n="12" />Epaphras, who is one of yourselves, sends you his greeting. He is a servant of Christ Jesus, and is always most earnest in your behalf in his prayers, praying that you may stand firm, with a matured faith and with a sure conviction of all that is in accordance with God’s will.
<verse eID="Col.4.12" />
<verse sID="Col.4.13" osisID="Col.4.13" n="13" />I can bear testimony to the deep interest he takes in you, as well as in the followers at Laodicea and at Hierapolis.
<verse eID="Col.4.13" />
<verse sID="Col.4.14" osisID="Col.4.14" n="14" />Luke, our dear doctor, sends you his greeting, and Demas sends his.
<verse eID="Col.4.14" />
<verse sID="Col.4.15" osisID="Col.4.15" n="15" />Give my greeting to the followers at Laodicea, and to Nymphe, and to the church that meets at her house.
<verse eID="Col.4.15" />
<verse sID="Col.4.16" osisID="Col.4.16" n="16" />And when this letter has been read to you, see that it is also read before the church at Laodicea, and that you yourselves read the letter which will be forwarded from there.

<p>
<verse sID="1Thess.1.2" osisID="1Thess.1.2" n="2" />We always mention you in our prayers and thank God for you all;
<verse eID="1Thess.1.2" />
<verse sID="1Thess.1.3" osisID="1Thess.1.3" n="3" />recalling continually before our God and Father the efforts that have resulted from your faith, the toil prompted by your love, and the patient endurance sustained by your hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.
<verse eID="1Thess.1.3" />
<verse sID="1Thess.1.4" osisID="1Thess.1.4" n="4" />Friends, whom God loves, we know that he has chosen you,
<verse eID="1Thess.1.4" />
<verse sID="1Thess.1.5" osisID="1Thess.1.5" n="5" />because the good news that we brought came home to you, not merely as so many words, but with a power and a fulness of conviction due to the Holy Spirit. For you know the life that we lived among you for your good.
<verse eID="1Thess.1.5" />
<verse sID="1Thess.1.6" osisID="1Thess.1.6" n="6" />And you yourselves began to follow, not only our example, but the Master’s also; and, in spite of much suffering, you welcomed the message with a joy inspired by the Holy Spirit,
<verse eID="1Thess.1.6" />
<verse sID="1Thess.1.7" osisID="1Thess.1.7" n="7" />and so became a pattern to all who believed in Christ throughout Macedonia and Greece.
<verse eID="1Thess.1.7" />
<verse sID="1Thess.1.8" osisID="1Thess.1.8" n="8" />For it was from you that the Lord’s message resounded throughout Macedonia and Greece; and, more than that, your faith in God has become known far and wide; so that there is no need for us to say another word.
<verse eID="1Thess.1.8" />
<verse sID="1Thess.1.9" osisID="1Thess.1.9" n="9" />Indeed, in speaking about us, the people themselves tell of the reception you gave us, and how, turning to God from your idols, you became servants of the true and living God,
<verse eID="1Thess.1.9" />
<verse sID="1Thess.1.10" osisID="1Thess.1.10" n="10" />and are now awaiting the return from heaven of his Son whom he raised from the dead – Jesus, our deliverer from the coming wrath.

<verse sID="1Thess.2.1" osisID="1Thess.2.1" n="1" />Yes, friends, you yourselves know that your reception of us was not without result.
<verse eID="1Thess.2.1" />
<verse sID="1Thess.2.2" osisID="1Thess.2.2" n="2" />For, although we had experienced suffering and ill treatment, as you know, at Philippi, we had the courage, by the help of our God, to tell you God’s good news in spite of great opposition.
<verse eID="1Thess.2.2" />
<verse sID="1Thess.2.3" osisID="1Thess.2.3" n="3" />Our appeal to you was not based on a delusion, nor was it made from unworthy motives, or with any intention of misleading you.
<verse eID="1Thess.2.3" />
<verse sID="1Thess.2.4" osisID="1Thess.2.4" n="4" />But, having been found worthy by God to be entrusted with the good news, therefore we tell it; with a view to please, not people, but God who proves our hearts.
<verse eID="1Thess.2.4" />
<verse sID="1Thess.2.5" osisID="1Thess.2.5" n="5" />Never at any time, as you know, did we use the language of flattery, or make false professions in order to hide selfish aims. God will bear witness to that.
<verse eID="1Thess.2.5" />
<verse sID="1Thess.2.6" osisID="1Thess.2.6" n="6" />Nor did we seek to win honor from people, whether from you or from others, although, as apostles of Christ, we might have burdened you with our support.
<verse eID="1Thess.2.6" />

<verse sID="1Thess.2.9" osisID="1Thess.2.9" n="9" />You will not have forgotten, friends, our labor and toil. Night and day we used to work at our trades, so as not be a burden to any of you, while we proclaimed to you God’s good news.
<verse eID="1Thess.2.9" />
<verse sID="1Thess.2.10" osisID="1Thess.2.10" n="10" />You will bear witness, and God also, that our relations with you who believed in Christ were pure, and upright, and beyond reproach.
<verse eID="1Thess.2.10" />
<verse sID="1Thess.2.11" osisID="1Thess.2.11" n="11" />Indeed, you know that, like a father with his own children, we used to encourage and comfort every one of you, and solemnly plead with you;
<verse eID="1Thess.2.11" />
<verse sID="1Thess.2.12" osisID="1Thess.2.12" n="12" />so that you should make your daily lives worthy of God who is calling you into the glory of his kingdom.
<verse eID="1Thess.2.12" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Thess.2.13" osisID="1Thess.2.13" n="13" />This, too, is a reason why we, on our part, are continually thanking God – because, in receiving the teaching that you had from us, you accepted it, not as the teaching of humans, but as what it really is – the teaching of God, which is even now doing its work within you who believe in Christ.
<verse eID="1Thess.2.13" />
<verse sID="1Thess.2.14" osisID="1Thess.2.14" n="14" />For you, friends, began to follow the example of the churches of God in Judea which are in union with Jesus Christ; you, in your turn, suffering at the hands of your fellow citizens, in the same way as those churches did at the hands of their people –
<verse eID="1Thess.2.14" />
<verse sID="1Thess.2.15" osisID="1Thess.2.15" n="15" />who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and persecuted us also. They do not try to please God, and they are enemies to all humanity,
<verse eID="1Thess.2.15" />
<verse sID="1Thess.2.16" osisID="1Thess.2.16" n="16" />for they try to prevent us from speaking to the Gentiles with a view to their salvation, and so are always filling up the measure of their iniquity. But the wrath of God has come upon them to the full!
<verse eID="1Thess.2.16" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Thess.2.17" osisID="1Thess.2.17" n="17" />As for ourselves, friends, our having been bereaved of you even for a short time – though in body only, and not in spirit – made us all the more eager to see your faces again; and the longing to do so was strong on us.
<verse eID="1Thess.2.17" />
<verse sID="1Thess.2.18" osisID="1Thess.2.18" n="18" />That was why we made up our minds to go and see you – at least I, Paul, did, more than once – but Satan put difficulties in our way.
<verse eID="1Thess.2.18" />
<verse sID="1Thess.2.19" osisID="1Thess.2.19" n="19" />For what hope or joy will be ours, or what crown will we have to boast of, in the presence of our Lord Jesus, at his coming, if it isn’t you?
<verse eID="1Thess.2.19" />
<verse sID="1Thess.2.20" osisID="1Thess.2.20" n="20" />You are our pride and our delight!
<verse eID="1Thess.2.20" />

<p>
<chapter sID="1Thess.3" osisID="1Thess.3" n="3" />
<verse sID="1Thess.3.1" osisID="1Thess.3.1" n="1" />And so, as we could bear it no longer, we made up our minds to remain behind alone at Athens,
<verse eID="1Thess.3.1" />
<verse sID="1Thess.3.2" osisID="1Thess.3.2" n="2" />and sent Timothy, our dear friend and God’s minister of the good news of the Christ, to strengthen you, and to encourage you in your faith,
<verse eID="1Thess.3.2" />
<verse sID="1Thess.3.3" osisID="1Thess.3.3" n="3" />so that none of you should be shaken by the troubles through which you are passing. You yourselves know that we are destined to meet with such things.
<verse eID="1Thess.3.3" />
<verse sID="1Thess.3.4" osisID="1Thess.3.4" n="4" />For, even while we were with you, we warned you beforehand that we were certain to encounter trouble. And so it proved, as you know.
<verse eID="1Thess.3.4" />
<verse sID="1Thess.3.5" osisID="1Thess.3.5" n="5" />Therefore, since I could no longer endure the uncertainty, I sent to make inquiries about your faith, fearing that the Tempter had tempted you, and that our toil might prove to have been in vain.
<verse eID="1Thess.3.5" />
<verse sID="1Thess.3.6" osisID="1Thess.3.6" n="6" />But, when Timothy recently returned to us from you with good news of your faith and love, and told us how kindly you think of us – always longing, he said, to see us, just as we are longing to see you –
<verse eID="1Thess.3.6" />
<verse sID="1Thess.3.7" osisID="1Thess.3.7" n="7" />on hearing this, we felt encouraged about you, friends, in the midst of all our difficulties and troubles, by your faith.
<verse eID="1Thess.3.7" />
<verse sID="1Thess.3.8" osisID="1Thess.3.8" n="8" />For it is new life to us to know that you are holding fast to the Lord.
<verse eID="1Thess.3.8" />
<verse sID="1Thess.3.9" osisID="1Thess.3.9" n="9" />How can we thank God enough for all the happiness that you are giving us in the sight of our God?
<verse eID="1Thess.3.9" />
<verse sID="1Thess.3.10" osisID="1Thess.3.10" n="10" />Night and day we pray most earnestly that we may see you face to face, and make good any deficiency in your faith.
<verse eID="1Thess.3.10" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Thess.3.11" osisID="1Thess.3.11" n="11" />May our God and Father himself, and Jesus, our Lord, make the way plain for us to come to you.
<verse eID="1Thess.3.11" />
<verse sID="1Thess.3.12" osisID="1Thess.3.12" n="12" />And for you, may the Lord fill you to overflowing with love for one another and for everyone, just as we are filled with love for you;
<verse eID="1Thess.3.12" />
<verse sID="1Thess.3.13" osisID="1Thess.3.13" n="13" />and so make your hearts strong, and your lives pure beyond reproach, in the sight of our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus, with all his Holy Ones.

<!-- s --><title>Advice on Daily Life</title>
<p>
<verse sID="1Thess.4.1" osisID="1Thess.4.1" n="1" />Further, friends, we beg and urge you in the name of our Lord Jesus to carry out more fully than ever – as indeed you are already doing – all that you have heard from us as to what your daily life must be, if it is to please God.
<verse eID="1Thess.4.1" />
<verse sID="1Thess.4.2" osisID="1Thess.4.2" n="2" />For you have not forgotten the directions that we gave you on the authority of our Lord Jesus.
<verse eID="1Thess.4.2" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Thess.4.3" osisID="1Thess.4.3" n="3" />For this is God’s purpose – that you should be pure; abstaining from all immorality;
<verse eID="1Thess.4.3" />
<verse sID="1Thess.4.4" osisID="1Thess.4.4" n="4" />each of you learning to gain control over your own body, in a way that is holy and honorable,
<verse eID="1Thess.4.4" />
<verse sID="1Thess.4.5" osisID="1Thess.4.5" n="5" />and not for the mere gratification of your passions, like the Gentiles who know nothing of God;
<verse eID="1Thess.4.5" />
<verse sID="1Thess.4.6" osisID="1Thess.4.6" n="6" />none of you overreaching or taking advantage of their fellow follower of the Lord in such matters. The Lord takes vengeance on all who do such things, as we have already warned you and solemnly declared.
<verse eID="1Thess.4.6" />
<verse sID="1Thess.4.7" osisID="1Thess.4.7" n="7" />For God’s call to us does not permit of an impure life, but demands purity.
<verse eID="1Thess.4.7" />
<verse sID="1Thess.4.8" osisID="1Thess.4.8" n="8" />Therefore the person who disregards this warning disregards, not people, but God who gives you his Holy Spirit.
<verse eID="1Thess.4.8" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Thess.4.9" osisID="1Thess.4.9" n="9" />As to love for each other there is no need to write to you; for you have yourselves been taught by God to love one another;
<verse eID="1Thess.4.9" />
<verse sID="1Thess.4.10" osisID="1Thess.4.10" n="10" />and indeed you do act in this spirit towards all his people throughout Macedonia.
</p>
<p>
Yet, friends, we beg you to do even more.
<verse eID="1Thess.4.10" />
<verse sID="1Thess.4.11" osisID="1Thess.4.11" n="11" />Make it your ambition to live quietly, and to attend to your own business, and to work with your hands, as we directed you;
<verse eID="1Thess.4.11" />
<verse sID="1Thess.4.12" osisID="1Thess.4.12" n="12" />so that your conduct may win respect from those outside the church, and that you may not want for anything.
</p>
<verse eID="1Thess.4.12" />
<!-- s --><title>The Dead in Christ at the coming of the Lord</title>
<p>
<verse sID="1Thess.4.13" osisID="1Thess.4.13" n="13" />We don’t want you to be ignorant, friends, about those who have passed to their rest. We don’t want you to grieve like other people who have no hope.
<verse eID="1Thess.4.13" />
<verse sID="1Thess.4.14" osisID="1Thess.4.14" n="14" />For, as we believe that Jesus died and rose again, so also we believe that God will bring, with Jesus, those who through him have passed to their rest.
<verse eID="1Thess.4.14" />
<verse sID="1Thess.4.15" osisID="1Thess.4.15" n="15" />This we tell you on the authority of the Lord – that those of us who are still living at the coming of the Lord will not anticipate those who have passed to their rest.
<verse eID="1Thess.4.15" />
<verse sID="1Thess.4.16" osisID="1Thess.4.16" n="16" />For, with a loud summons, with the shout of an archangel, and with the trumpet-call of God, the Lord himself will come down from heaven.
<verse eID="1Thess.4.16" />
<verse sID="1Thess.4.17" osisID="1Thess.4.17" n="17" />Then those who died in union with Christ will rise first; and afterward we who are still living will be caught up in the clouds, with them, to meet the Lord in the air; and so we will be for ever with the Lord.
<verse eID="1Thess.4.17" />
<verse sID="1Thess.4.18" osisID="1Thess.4.18" n="18" />Therefore, comfort one another with what I have told you.

<p>
<chapter sID="1Thess.5" osisID="1Thess.5" n="5" />
<verse sID="1Thess.5.1" osisID="1Thess.5.1" n="1" />But as to the times and the moments, there is no need, friends, for anyone to write to you.
<verse eID="1Thess.5.1" />
<verse sID="1Thess.5.2" osisID="1Thess.5.2" n="2" />You yourselves know well that the day of the Lord will come just as a thief comes in the night.
<verse eID="1Thess.5.2" />
<verse sID="1Thess.5.3" osisID="1Thess.5.3" n="3" />When people are saying ‘All is quiet and safe,’ it is then that, like birth pains on a pregnant woman, ruin comes suddenly upon them, and there will be no escape!
<verse eID="1Thess.5.3" />
<verse sID="1Thess.5.4" osisID="1Thess.5.4" n="4" />You, however, friends, are not in darkness, that the daylight should take you by surprise as if you were thieves.
<verse eID="1Thess.5.4" />
<verse sID="1Thess.5.5" osisID="1Thess.5.5" n="5" />For you all are children of light and children of the day.
</p>
<p>
We have nothing to do with night, or darkness.
<verse eID="1Thess.5.5" />
<verse sID="1Thess.5.6" osisID="1Thess.5.6" n="6" />Therefore let us not sleep as others do. No, let us be watchful and self-controlled.
<verse eID="1Thess.5.6" />
<verse sID="1Thess.5.7" osisID="1Thess.5.7" n="7" />It is at night that people sleep, and at night that drunkards get drunk.
<verse eID="1Thess.5.7" />
<verse sID="1Thess.5.8" osisID="1Thess.5.8" n="8" />But let us, who belong to the day, control ourselves, and put on faith and love as a breast plate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet.
<verse eID="1Thess.5.8" />
<verse sID="1Thess.5.9" osisID="1Thess.5.9" n="9" />For God destined us, not for wrath, but to win salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us,
<verse eID="1Thess.5.9" />
<verse sID="1Thess.5.10" osisID="1Thess.5.10" n="10" />that, whether we are still watching or have fallen asleep, we may live with him.
<verse eID="1Thess.5.10" />
<verse sID="1Thess.5.11" osisID="1Thess.5.11" n="11" />Therefore encourage one another, and try to build up one another’s characters, as indeed you are doing.

<verse eID="2Thess.1.3" />
<verse sID="2Thess.1.4" osisID="2Thess.1.4" n="4" />So much is this the case that we ourselves speak with pride, before the churches of God, of the patience and faith which you have shown, in spite of all the persecutions and troubles that you are enduring.
<verse eID="2Thess.1.4" />
<verse sID="2Thess.1.5" osisID="2Thess.1.5" n="5" />These persecutions will vindicate the justice of God’s judgment, and will result in your being reckoned worthy of God’s kingdom, for the sake of which you are now suffering;
<verse eID="2Thess.1.5" />
<verse sID="2Thess.1.6" osisID="2Thess.1.6" n="6" />since God deems it just to inflict suffering on those who are now inflicting suffering on you,

<verse sID="2Thess.2.1" osisID="2Thess.2.1" n="1" />As to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our being gathered to meet him, we beg you, friends,
<verse eID="2Thess.2.1" />
<verse sID="2Thess.2.2" osisID="2Thess.2.2" n="2" />not lightly to let your minds become unsettled, or disturbed by any revelation, or by any message, or by any letter, purporting to come from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord is come.
<verse eID="2Thess.2.2" />
<verse sID="2Thess.2.3" osisID="2Thess.2.3" n="3" />Do not let anyone deceive you, whatever he may do. For it will not come until after the Great Apostasy, and the appearing of that Incarnation of Wickedness, that Lost Soul,
<verse eID="2Thess.2.3" />
<verse sID="2Thess.2.4" osisID="2Thess.2.4" n="4" />who so opposes himself to everyone that is spoken of as a God or as an object of worship, and so exalts himself above them, that he seats himself in the Temple of God, and displays himself as God!
<verse eID="2Thess.2.4" />
<verse sID="2Thess.2.5" osisID="2Thess.2.5" n="5" />Don’t you remember how, when I was with you, I used to speak to you of all this?
<verse eID="2Thess.2.5" />
<verse sID="2Thess.2.6" osisID="2Thess.2.6" n="6" />And you know now what the restraining influence is which prevents his appearing before his appointed time.
<verse eID="2Thess.2.6" />
<verse sID="2Thess.2.7" osisID="2Thess.2.7" n="7" />Wickedness, indeed, is already at work in secret; but only until he who at present restrains it is removed out of the way.
<verse eID="2Thess.2.7" />
<verse sID="2Thess.2.8" osisID="2Thess.2.8" n="8" />Then will ‘Wickedness Incarnate’ appear, but the Lord Jesus will destroy him with the breath of his lips, and annihilate him by the splendor of his coming.
<verse eID="2Thess.2.8" />
<verse sID="2Thess.2.9" osisID="2Thess.2.9" n="9" />For at the coming of the Lord there will be great activity on the part of Satan, in the form of all kinds of deceptive miracles, signs, and marvels, as well as of wicked attempts to delude –
<verse eID="2Thess.2.9" />
<verse sID="2Thess.2.10" osisID="2Thess.2.10" n="10" />to the ruin of those who are on the path to destruction, because they have never received and loved the truth to their own salvation.
<verse eID="2Thess.2.10" />
<verse sID="2Thess.2.11" osisID="2Thess.2.11" n="11" />That is why God places them under the influence of a delusion, to cause them to believe a lie;
<verse eID="2Thess.2.11" />
<verse sID="2Thess.2.12" osisID="2Thess.2.12" n="12" />so that sentence may be passed on all those who refuse to believe the truth, but delight in wickedness.
<verse eID="2Thess.2.12" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="2Thess.2.13" osisID="2Thess.2.13" n="13" />But, friends, whom the Lord loves, it is our duty always to thank God about you, for, from the first, God chose you for salvation through the purifying influence of the Spirit, and your belief in the truth.
<verse eID="2Thess.2.13" />

<verse eID="2Thess.2.14" />
<verse sID="2Thess.2.15" osisID="2Thess.2.15" n="15" />Stand firm then, friends, and hold fast to the truths that we taught you, whether by word or by letter.
<verse eID="2Thess.2.15" />
<verse sID="2Thess.2.16" osisID="2Thess.2.16" n="16" />And may our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father, who loved us and, in his loving kindness, gave us unfailing consolation and good ground for hope,
<verse eID="2Thess.2.16" />
<verse sID="2Thess.2.17" osisID="2Thess.2.17" n="17" />console your hearts, and strengthen you to do and to say all that is right.

<!-- s --><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>
<verse sID="2Thess.3.1" osisID="2Thess.3.1" n="1" />In conclusion, friends, pray for us – pray that the Lord’s message may spread rapidly, and be received everywhere with honor, as it was among you;
<verse eID="2Thess.3.1" />
<verse sID="2Thess.3.2" osisID="2Thess.3.2" n="2" />and that we may be preserved from wrong-headed and wicked people – for it is not everyone who believes in Christ.
<verse eID="2Thess.3.2" />
<verse sID="2Thess.3.3" osisID="2Thess.3.3" n="3" />But the Lord will not fail you. He will give you strength, and guard you from evil.
<verse eID="2Thess.3.3" />
<verse sID="2Thess.3.4" osisID="2Thess.3.4" n="4" />Yes, and the confidence that our union with the Lord enables us to place in you leads us to believe that you are doing, and will do, what we direct you.
<verse eID="2Thess.3.4" />
<verse sID="2Thess.3.5" osisID="2Thess.3.5" n="5" />May the Lord bring you to the love of God, and to the patience of the Christ.
<verse eID="2Thess.3.5" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="2Thess.3.6" osisID="2Thess.3.6" n="6" />We beg you, friends, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, to avoid any follower who is living an ill-ordered life, which is not in agreement with the teaching that you received from us.
<verse eID="2Thess.3.6" />
<verse sID="2Thess.3.7" osisID="2Thess.3.7" n="7" />For you know well that you ought to follow our example. When we were with you, our life was not ill-ordered,
<verse eID="2Thess.3.7" />
<verse sID="2Thess.3.8" osisID="2Thess.3.8" n="8" />nor did we eat anyone’s bread without paying for it. Night and day, laboring and toiling, we used to work at our trades, so as not to be a burden on any of you.
<verse eID="2Thess.3.8" />
<verse sID="2Thess.3.9" osisID="2Thess.3.9" n="9" />This was not because we had not a right to receive support, but our object was to give you a pattern for you to copy.
<verse eID="2Thess.3.9" />
<verse sID="2Thess.3.10" osisID="2Thess.3.10" n="10" />Indeed, when we were with you, the rule we laid down was – ‘Whoever does not choose to work will not get to eat.’
<verse eID="2Thess.3.10" />
<verse sID="2Thess.3.11" osisID="2Thess.3.11" n="11" />We hear that there are among you people who are living ill-ordered lives, and who, instead of attending to their own business, are mere busybodies.
<verse eID="2Thess.3.11" />
<verse sID="2Thess.3.12" osisID="2Thess.3.12" n="12" />All such people we beg, and implore, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, to attend quietly to their business, and earn their own living.
<verse eID="2Thess.3.12" />
<verse sID="2Thess.3.13" osisID="2Thess.3.13" n="13" />You, friends, must not grow weary of doing what is right.
<verse eID="2Thess.3.13" />
<verse sID="2Thess.3.14" osisID="2Thess.3.14" n="14" />If anyone disregards what we have said in this letter, take note of them and avoid their company, so that they may feel ashamed.
<verse eID="2Thess.3.14" />
<verse sID="2Thess.3.15" osisID="2Thess.3.15" n="15" />Yet do not think of them as an enemy, but caution them as you would a brother or sister.
<verse eID="2Thess.3.15" />
<verse sID="2Thess.3.16" osisID="2Thess.3.16" n="16" />May the Lord, from whom all peace comes, himself give you his peace at all times and in all ways. May he be with you all.
<verse eID="2Thess.3.16" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="2Thess.3.17" osisID="2Thess.3.17" n="17" />I, Paul, add this greeting in my own handwriting. It is my signature to every letter. This is how I write.
<verse eID="2Thess.3.17" />
<verse sID="2Thess.3.18" osisID="2Thess.3.18" n="18" />May the blessing of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.

<chapter sID="1Tim.1" osisID="1Tim.1" n="1" />
<!-- s --><title>Introduction</title>
<p>
<verse sID="1Tim.1.1" osisID="1Tim.1.1" n="1" />From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the appointment of God, our Savior, and Christ Jesus, our hope.
<verse eID="1Tim.1.1" />
<verse sID="1Tim.1.2" osisID="1Tim.1.2" n="2" />To Timothy, my true child in the faith: May God, the Father, and Christ Jesus, our Lord, bless you, and be merciful to you, and give you peace.
<verse eID="1Tim.1.2" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Tim.1.3" osisID="1Tim.1.3" n="3" />I beg you, as I did when I was on my way into Macedonia, to remain at Ephesus; so that you may instruct certain people there not to teach new and strange doctrines,
<verse eID="1Tim.1.3" />
<verse sID="1Tim.1.4" osisID="1Tim.1.4" n="4" />nor to devote their attention to legends and interminable genealogies, which tend to give rise to argument rather than to further that divine plan which is revealed in the faith.
<verse eID="1Tim.1.4" />
<verse sID="1Tim.1.5" osisID="1Tim.1.5" n="5" />The object of all instruction is to call forth that love which comes from a pure heart, a clear conscience, and a sincere faith.
<verse eID="1Tim.1.5" />
<verse sID="1Tim.1.6" osisID="1Tim.1.6" n="6" />And it is because they have not aimed at these things that the attention of certain people has been diverted to unprofitable subjects.
<verse eID="1Tim.1.6" />
<verse sID="1Tim.1.7" osisID="1Tim.1.7" n="7" />They want to be teachers of the Law, and yet do not understand either the words they use, or the subjects on which they speak so confidently.
<verse eID="1Tim.1.7" />
<verse sID="1Tim.1.8" osisID="1Tim.1.8" n="8" />We know, of course, that the Law is excellent, when used legitimately,
<verse eID="1Tim.1.8" />
<verse sID="1Tim.1.9" osisID="1Tim.1.9" n="9" />by one who recognizes that laws were not made for good people, but for the lawless and disorderly, for irreligious and wicked people, for those who are irreverent and profane, for those who ill-treat their fathers or mothers, for murderers,
<verse eID="1Tim.1.9" />
<verse sID="1Tim.1.10" osisID="1Tim.1.10" n="10" />for the immoral, for perverts, for slave-dealers, for liars, for perjurers, and for whatever else is opposed to sound Christian teaching –
<verse eID="1Tim.1.10" />
<verse sID="1Tim.1.11" osisID="1Tim.1.11" n="11" />as is taught in the glorious good news of the ever-blessed God, with which I was entrusted.
<verse eID="1Tim.1.11" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Tim.1.12" osisID="1Tim.1.12" n="12" />I am thankful to Christ Jesus, our Lord, who has been my strength, for showing that he thought me worthy of trust by appointing me to his ministry,
<verse eID="1Tim.1.12" />
<verse sID="1Tim.1.13" osisID="1Tim.1.13" n="13" />though I once used to blaspheme, and to persecute, and to insult. Yet mercy was shown me, because I acted in ignorance, while still an unbeliever;
<verse eID="1Tim.1.13" />
<verse sID="1Tim.1.14" osisID="1Tim.1.14" n="14" />and the loving kindness of our Lord was boundless, and filled me with that faith and love which come from union with Christ Jesus.
<verse eID="1Tim.1.14" />
<verse sID="1Tim.1.15" osisID="1Tim.1.15" n="15" />How true the saying is, and worthy of the fullest acceptance, that ‘Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners’! And there is no greater sinner than I!
<verse eID="1Tim.1.15" />
<verse sID="1Tim.1.16" osisID="1Tim.1.16" n="16" />Yet mercy was shown me for the express purpose that Christ Jesus might exhibit in my case, beyond all others, his exhaustless patience, as an example for those who were afterward to believe on him and attain eternal life.
<verse eID="1Tim.1.16" />
<verse sID="1Tim.1.17" osisID="1Tim.1.17" n="17" />To the eternal King, ever-living, invisible, the one God, be ascribed honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.
<verse eID="1Tim.1.17" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Tim.1.18" osisID="1Tim.1.18" n="18" />This, then, is the charge that I lay on you, Timothy, my child, in accordance with what was predicted of you – Fight the good fight in the spirit of those predictions,
<verse eID="1Tim.1.18" />
<verse sID="1Tim.1.19" osisID="1Tim.1.19" n="19" />with faith, and with a clear conscience; and it is because they have thrust this aside, that, as regards the faith, some have wrecked their lives.
<verse eID="1Tim.1.19" />
<verse sID="1Tim.1.20" osisID="1Tim.1.20" n="20" />Hymenaeus and Alexander are instances – the men whom I delivered over to Satan so that they might be taught not to blaspheme.

<!-- s --><title>General Directions on Church Matters</title>
<p>
<verse sID="1Tim.2.1" osisID="1Tim.2.1" n="1" />First of all, then, I ask that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings should be offered for everyone,
<verse eID="1Tim.2.1" />
<verse sID="1Tim.2.2" osisID="1Tim.2.2" n="2" />especially for kings and all who are in high positions, in order that we may lead a quiet and peaceful life in a deeply religious and reverent spirit.
<verse eID="1Tim.2.2" />
<verse sID="1Tim.2.3" osisID="1Tim.2.3" n="3" />This will be good and acceptable in the eyes of God, our Savior,
<verse eID="1Tim.2.3" />
<verse sID="1Tim.2.4" osisID="1Tim.2.4" n="4" />whose will is that everyone should be saved, and attain to a full knowledge of the truth.
<verse eID="1Tim.2.4" />
<verse sID="1Tim.2.5" osisID="1Tim.2.5" n="5" />There is but one God, and one mediator between God and humanity – the human, Christ Jesus,
<verse eID="1Tim.2.5" />
<verse sID="1Tim.2.6" osisID="1Tim.2.6" n="6" />who gave himself as a ransom on behalf of all.
</p>
<p>
This must be our testimony, as opportunities present themselves;
<verse eID="1Tim.2.6" />
<verse sID="1Tim.2.7" osisID="1Tim.2.7" n="7" />and it was for this that I was myself appointed a herald and an apostle (I am telling the simple truth and no lie) – a teacher of the Gentiles in the faith and truth.
<verse eID="1Tim.2.7" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Tim.2.8" osisID="1Tim.2.8" n="8" />My desire, then, is that it should be the custom everywhere for the men to lead the prayers, with hands reverently uplifted, avoiding heated controversy.
<verse eID="1Tim.2.8" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Tim.2.9" osisID="1Tim.2.9" n="9" />I also desire that women should adorn themselves with appropriate dress, worn quietly and modestly, and not with wreaths or gold ornaments for the hair, or pearls, or costly clothing,
<verse eID="1Tim.2.9" />
<verse sID="1Tim.2.10" osisID="1Tim.2.10" n="10" />but – as is proper for women who profess to be religious – with good actions.
<verse eID="1Tim.2.10" />
<verse sID="1Tim.2.11" osisID="1Tim.2.11" n="11" />They must learn, listening quietly to their teachers and showing them all deference.
<verse eID="1Tim.2.11" />
<verse sID="1Tim.2.12" osisID="1Tim.2.12" n="12" />I do not consent to them becoming teachers, or exercising authority over men; they ought to not make a fuss.
<verse eID="1Tim.2.12" />
<verse sID="1Tim.2.13" osisID="1Tim.2.13" n="13" />Adam was formed first, not Eve.
<verse eID="1Tim.2.13" />
<verse sID="1Tim.2.14" osisID="1Tim.2.14" n="14" />And it was not Adam who was deceived; it was the woman who was entirely deceived and fell into sin.
<verse eID="1Tim.2.14" />
<verse sID="1Tim.2.15" osisID="1Tim.2.15" n="15" />But she will be saved by the birth of a child, if they never abandon faith, love, or holiness, and behave with modesty.
<verse eID="1Tim.2.15" />
<chapter eID="1Tim.2" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="1Tim.3" osisID="1Tim.3" n="3" />
<verse sID="1Tim.3.1" osisID="1Tim.3.1" n="1" />How true is this saying: ‘To aspire to be to be a supervisor in the church is to be ambitious for a noble task.’
<verse eID="1Tim.3.1" />
<verse sID="1Tim.3.2" osisID="1Tim.3.2" n="2" />The supervisor should be of blameless character; a faithful partner; living a temperate, discreet, and well-ordered life; hospitable, and a skillful teacher,
<verse eID="1Tim.3.2" />
<verse sID="1Tim.3.3" osisID="1Tim.3.3" n="3" />not addicted to drink or brawling, but of a forbearing and peaceable disposition, and not a lover of money;
<verse eID="1Tim.3.3" />
<verse sID="1Tim.3.4" osisID="1Tim.3.4" n="4" />they should provide for own household well, and their children should kept under control and be well-behaved.
<verse eID="1Tim.3.4" />
<verse sID="1Tim.3.5" osisID="1Tim.3.5" n="5" />If someone does not know how to provide for their own household, how can they take charge of the church of God?
<verse eID="1Tim.3.5" />
<verse sID="1Tim.3.6" osisID="1Tim.3.6" n="6" />The supervisor should not be a recent convert, or they might become blinded by pride and fall under the same judgment as the devil.
<verse eID="1Tim.3.6" />
<verse sID="1Tim.3.7" osisID="1Tim.3.7" n="7" />They should also be well spoken of by outsiders, so that they may not incur censure and so fall into the devil’s trap.
<verse eID="1Tim.3.7" />
<verse sID="1Tim.3.8" osisID="1Tim.3.8" n="8" />So, too, assistants should be serious and straightforward, not given to taking much drink or to questionable money-making,
<verse eID="1Tim.3.8" />
<verse sID="1Tim.3.9" osisID="1Tim.3.9" n="9" />but people who hold the deep truths of the faith and have a clear conscience.
<verse eID="1Tim.3.9" />
<verse sID="1Tim.3.10" osisID="1Tim.3.10" n="10" />They should be tested first, and only appointed to their office if no objection is raised against them.
<verse eID="1Tim.3.10" />
<verse sID="1Tim.3.11" osisID="1Tim.3.11" n="11" />It should be the same with the women in this office. They should be serious, not gossips, sober, and trustworthy in all respects.
<verse eID="1Tim.3.11" />
<verse sID="1Tim.3.12" osisID="1Tim.3.12" n="12" />Assistants should be faithful partners who manage their children and their households well.
<verse eID="1Tim.3.12" />
<verse sID="1Tim.3.13" osisID="1Tim.3.13" n="13" />Those who have filled that post with honor gain for themselves an honorable position, as well as great confidence through the faith that they place in Christ Jesus.

<!-- s --><title>Special Directions to Timothy</title>
<p>
<verse sID="1Tim.3.14" osisID="1Tim.3.14" n="14" />I am writing this to you, though I hope that I will come to see you before long;
<verse eID="1Tim.3.14" />
<verse sID="1Tim.3.15" osisID="1Tim.3.15" n="15" />but in case I should be delayed, I want you to know what your conduct ought to be in the Household of God, which is the church of the living God – the pillar and stay of the truth.
<verse eID="1Tim.3.15" />
<verse sID="1Tim.3.16" osisID="1Tim.3.16" n="16" />Yes, and confessedly wonderful are the deep truths of our religion; for –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘He was revealed in our nature,</l>
<l level="2">pronounced righteous in spirit,</l>
<l level="3">seen by angels,</l>
<l level="1">proclaimed among the Gentiles,</l>
<l level="2">believed on in the world,</l>
<l level="3">taken up into glory.’ <verse eID="1Tim.3.16" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<chapter eID="1Tim.3" />
<chapter sID="1Tim.4" osisID="1Tim.4" n="4" />
<verse sID="1Tim.4.1" osisID="1Tim.4.1" n="1" />But the Spirit distinctly says that in later times there will be some who will fall away from the faith, and devote their attention to misleading spirits, and to the teaching of demons,
<verse eID="1Tim.4.1" />
<verse sID="1Tim.4.2" osisID="1Tim.4.2" n="2" />who will make use of the hypocrisy of lying teachers. These people’s consciences are seared,
<verse eID="1Tim.4.2" />
<verse sID="1Tim.4.3" osisID="1Tim.4.3" n="3" />and they discourage marriage and enjoin abstinence from certain kinds of food; though God created these foods to be enjoyed thankfully by those who hold the faith and have attained a full knowledge of the truth.
<verse eID="1Tim.4.3" />
<verse sID="1Tim.4.4" osisID="1Tim.4.4" n="4" />Everything created by God is good, and there in nothing that need be rejected – provided only that it is received thankfully;
<verse eID="1Tim.4.4" />
<verse sID="1Tim.4.5" osisID="1Tim.4.5" n="5" />for it is consecrated by God’s blessing and by prayer.
<verse eID="1Tim.4.5" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Tim.4.6" osisID="1Tim.4.6" n="6" />Put all this before the followers, and you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, sustained by the precepts of the faith and of that good teaching by which you have guided your life.
<verse eID="1Tim.4.6" />
<verse sID="1Tim.4.7" osisID="1Tim.4.7" n="7" />As for profane legends and old wives’ tales, leave them alone. Train yourself to lead a religious life;
<verse eID="1Tim.4.7" />
<verse sID="1Tim.4.8" osisID="1Tim.4.8" n="8" />for while the training of the body is of service in some respects, religion is of service in all, carrying with it, as it does, a promise of life both here and hereafter.
<verse eID="1Tim.4.8" />
<verse sID="1Tim.4.9" osisID="1Tim.4.9" n="9" />How true that saying is and worthy of the fullest acceptance!
<verse eID="1Tim.4.9" />
<verse sID="1Tim.4.10" osisID="1Tim.4.10" n="10" />With that aim we toil and struggle, for we have set our hopes on the living God, who is the Savior of all, and especially of those who hold the faith.
<verse eID="1Tim.4.10" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Tim.4.11" osisID="1Tim.4.11" n="11" />Remember these things in your teaching.
<verse eID="1Tim.4.11" />
<verse sID="1Tim.4.12" osisID="1Tim.4.12" n="12" />Do not let anyone look down on you because you are young, but, by your conversation, your conduct, your love, your faith, and your purity, be an example to those who hold the faith.
<verse eID="1Tim.4.12" />
<verse sID="1Tim.4.13" osisID="1Tim.4.13" n="13" />Until I come, apply yourself to public reading, preaching, and teaching.
<verse eID="1Tim.4.13" />
<verse sID="1Tim.4.14" osisID="1Tim.4.14" n="14" />Do not neglect the divine gift within you, which was given you, amid many a prediction, when the hands of the church elders were laid on your head.
<verse eID="1Tim.4.14" />
<verse sID="1Tim.4.15" osisID="1Tim.4.15" n="15" />Practice these things, devote yourself to them, so that your progress may be plain to everyone.
<verse eID="1Tim.4.15" />
<verse sID="1Tim.4.16" osisID="1Tim.4.16" n="16" />Look to yourself as well as to your teaching. Persevere in this, for your doing so will mean salvation for yourself as well as for your hearers.
<verse eID="1Tim.4.16" />
<chapter eID="1Tim.4" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="1Tim.5" osisID="1Tim.5" n="5" />
<verse sID="1Tim.5.1" osisID="1Tim.5.1" n="1" />Do not reprimand an older man, but plead with him as if he were your father. Treat the young men as brothers,
<verse eID="1Tim.5.1" />
<verse sID="1Tim.5.2" osisID="1Tim.5.2" n="2" />the older women as mothers, and the younger women as sisters – with all purity.
<verse eID="1Tim.5.2" />
<verse sID="1Tim.5.3" osisID="1Tim.5.3" n="3" />Show consideration for widows – I mean those who are really widowed.
<verse eID="1Tim.5.3" />
<verse sID="1Tim.5.4" osisID="1Tim.5.4" n="4" />But, if a widow has children or grandchildren, they should learn to show proper regard for the members of their own family first, and to make some return to their parents; for that is pleasing in God’s sight.
<verse eID="1Tim.5.4" />
<verse sID="1Tim.5.5" osisID="1Tim.5.5" n="5" />As for the woman who is really widowed and left quite alone, her hopes are fixed on God, and she devotes herself to prayers and supplications night and day.
<verse eID="1Tim.5.5" />
<verse sID="1Tim.5.6" osisID="1Tim.5.6" n="6" />But the life of a widow who is devoted to pleasure is a living death.
<verse eID="1Tim.5.6" />
<verse sID="1Tim.5.7" osisID="1Tim.5.7" n="7" />Those are the points you should teach, so that there may be no call for your censure.
<verse eID="1Tim.5.7" />
<verse sID="1Tim.5.8" osisID="1Tim.5.8" n="8" />Anyone who fails to provide for their own relatives, and especially for those under their own roof, has disowned the faith, and is worse than an unbeliever.
<verse eID="1Tim.5.8" />
<verse sID="1Tim.5.9" osisID="1Tim.5.9" n="9" />A widow, when her name is added to the list, should not be less than sixty years old; she should have been a faithful wife,
<verse eID="1Tim.5.9" />
<verse sID="1Tim.5.10" osisID="1Tim.5.10" n="10" />and be well spoken of for her kind actions. She should have brought up children, have shown hospitality to strangers, have washed the feet of her fellow Christians, have relieved those who were in distress, and devoted herself to every kind of good action.
<verse eID="1Tim.5.10" />
<verse sID="1Tim.5.11" osisID="1Tim.5.11" n="11" />But you should exclude the younger widows from the list; for, when they grow restive under the yoke of the Christ, they want to marry,
<verse eID="1Tim.5.11" />
<verse sID="1Tim.5.12" osisID="1Tim.5.12" n="12" />and so they bring condemnation on themselves for having broken their previous promise.
<verse eID="1Tim.5.12" />
<verse sID="1Tim.5.13" osisID="1Tim.5.13" n="13" />And not only that, but they learn to be idle as they go about from house to house. Nor are they merely idle, but they also become gossips and busybodies, and talk of what they ought not.
<verse eID="1Tim.5.13" />
<verse sID="1Tim.5.14" osisID="1Tim.5.14" n="14" />Therefore I advise young widows to marry, bear children, and attend to their homes, and so avoid giving the enemy an opportunity for scandal.
<verse eID="1Tim.5.14" />
<verse sID="1Tim.5.15" osisID="1Tim.5.15" n="15" />There are some who have already left us, to follow Satan.
<verse eID="1Tim.5.15" />
<verse sID="1Tim.5.16" osisID="1Tim.5.16" n="16" />Any Christian woman, who has relatives who are widows, ought to relieve them and not allow them to become a burden to the church, so that the church may relieve those widows who are really widowed.
<verse eID="1Tim.5.16" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Tim.5.17" osisID="1Tim.5.17" n="17" />Those church elders who fill their office well should be held deserving of especial consideration, particularly those whose work lies in preaching and teaching.
<verse eID="1Tim.5.17" />
<verse sID="1Tim.5.18" osisID="1Tim.5.18" n="18" />The words of scripture are –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘You should not muzzle the ox while it is treading out the grain.’ </l>

<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="1Tim.5.19" osisID="1Tim.5.19" n="19" />Do not entertain a charge against an church elder, unless it is supported by two or three witnesses;
<verse eID="1Tim.5.19" />
<verse sID="1Tim.5.20" osisID="1Tim.5.20" n="20" />but rebuke offenders publicly, so that others may take warning.
<verse eID="1Tim.5.20" />
<verse sID="1Tim.5.21" osisID="1Tim.5.21" n="21" />I charge you solemnly, before God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels, to carry out these directions, unswayed by prejudice, never acting with partiality.
<verse eID="1Tim.5.21" />
<verse sID="1Tim.5.22" osisID="1Tim.5.22" n="22" />Never ordain anyone hastily, and take no part in the wrong-doing of others. Keep your life pure.
<verse eID="1Tim.5.22" />
<verse sID="1Tim.5.23" osisID="1Tim.5.23" n="23" />Do not continue to drink water only, but take a little wine because of the weakness of your stomach, and your frequent ailments.
<verse eID="1Tim.5.23" />
<verse sID="1Tim.5.24" osisID="1Tim.5.24" n="24" />There are some people whose sins are conspicuous and lead on to judgment, while there are others whose sins dog their steps.
<verse eID="1Tim.5.24" />
<verse sID="1Tim.5.25" osisID="1Tim.5.25" n="25" />In the same way noble deeds become conspicuous, and those which are otherwise cannot be concealed.
<verse eID="1Tim.5.25" />
<chapter eID="1Tim.5" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="1Tim.6" osisID="1Tim.6" n="6" />
<verse sID="1Tim.6.1" osisID="1Tim.6.1" n="1" />All who are in the position of slaves should regard their masters as deserving of the greatest respect, so that the name of God, and our teaching, may not be maligned.
<verse eID="1Tim.6.1" />
<verse sID="1Tim.6.2" osisID="1Tim.6.2" n="2" />Those who have Christian masters should not think less of them because they are also followers of Christ, but on the contrary they should serve them all the better, because those who are to benefit by their good work are dear to them as their fellow Christians.

<verse eID="1Tim.6.2" />
<!-- s --><title>Conclusion Those are the things to insist on in your teaching.</title>
<p>
<verse sID="1Tim.6.3" osisID="1Tim.6.3" n="3" />Anyone who teaches otherwise, and refuses their assent to sound instruction – the instruction of our Lord Jesus Christ – and to the teaching of religion,
<verse eID="1Tim.6.3" />
<verse sID="1Tim.6.4" osisID="1Tim.6.4" n="4" />is puffed up with conceit, not really knowing anything, but having a morbid craving for discussions and arguments. Such things only give rise to envy, quarreling, recriminations, base suspicions,
<verse eID="1Tim.6.4" />
<verse sID="1Tim.6.5" osisID="1Tim.6.5" n="5" />and incessant wrangling on the part of these corrupt-minded people who have lost all hold on the truth, and who think of religion only as a source of gain.
<verse eID="1Tim.6.5" />
<verse sID="1Tim.6.6" osisID="1Tim.6.6" n="6" />Of course religion is a great source of gain – when combined with contentment!
<verse eID="1Tim.6.6" />
<verse sID="1Tim.6.7" osisID="1Tim.6.7" n="7" />For we brought nothing into the world, because we cannot even carry anything out of it.
<verse eID="1Tim.6.7" />
<verse sID="1Tim.6.8" osisID="1Tim.6.8" n="8" />So, with food and shelter, we will be content.
<verse eID="1Tim.6.8" />
<verse sID="1Tim.6.9" osisID="1Tim.6.9" n="9" />Those who want to be rich fall into the net of temptation, and become the prey of many foolish and harmful ambitions, which plunge people into destruction and ruin.
<verse eID="1Tim.6.9" />
<verse sID="1Tim.6.10" osisID="1Tim.6.10" n="10" />Love of money is a source of all kinds of evil; and in their eagerness to be rich some have wandered away from the faith, and have been pierced to the heart by many a regret.
<verse eID="1Tim.6.10" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Tim.6.11" osisID="1Tim.6.11" n="11" />But you must, servant of God, avoid all this. Aim at righteousness, piety, faith, love, endurance, gentleness.
<verse eID="1Tim.6.11" />
<verse sID="1Tim.6.12" osisID="1Tim.6.12" n="12" />Run the great race of the faith, and win the eternal life. It was for this that you received the call, and, in the presence of many witnesses, made the great profession of faith.
<verse eID="1Tim.6.12" />
<verse sID="1Tim.6.13" osisID="1Tim.6.13" n="13" />I beg you, as in the sight of God, the source of all life, and of Christ Jesus who before Pontius Pilate made the great profession of faith –
<verse eID="1Tim.6.13" />
<verse sID="1Tim.6.14" osisID="1Tim.6.14" n="14" />I implore you to keep his command free from stain or reproach, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.
<verse eID="1Tim.6.14" />
<verse sID="1Tim.6.15" osisID="1Tim.6.15" n="15" />This will be brought about in his own time by the one ever-blessed Potentate, the king of all kings and Lord of all lords,
<verse eID="1Tim.6.15" />
<verse sID="1Tim.6.16" osisID="1Tim.6.16" n="16" />who alone is possessed of immortality and dwells in unapproachable light, whom no one has ever seen or ever can see – to whom be ascribed honor and power for ever. Amen.
<verse eID="1Tim.6.16" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Tim.6.17" osisID="1Tim.6.17" n="17" />Teach those who are wealthy in this life not to pride themselves, or fix their hopes, on so uncertain a thing as wealth, but on God, who gives us a wealth of enjoyment on every side.
<verse eID="1Tim.6.17" />
<verse sID="1Tim.6.18" osisID="1Tim.6.18" n="18" />Teach them to show kindness, to exhibit a wealth of good actions, to be open-handed and generous,
<verse eID="1Tim.6.18" />
<verse sID="1Tim.6.19" osisID="1Tim.6.19" n="19" />storing up for themselves what in the future will prove to be a good foundation, so that they may gain the only true life.
<verse eID="1Tim.6.19" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Tim.6.20" osisID="1Tim.6.20" n="20" />Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you. Avoid the profane prattle and contradictions of what some miscall ‘theology,’
<verse eID="1Tim.6.20" />
<verse sID="1Tim.6.21" osisID="1Tim.6.21" n="21" />for there are those who, while asserting their proficiency in it, have yet, as regards the faith, gone altogether astray.
</p>
<p>
God bless you all.

<!-- s --><title>Introduction</title>
<p>
<verse sID="2Tim.1.1" osisID="2Tim.1.1" n="1" />From Paul who, by the will of God, is an apostle of Christ Jesus, charged to proclaim the life that comes from union with Christ Jesus,
<verse eID="2Tim.1.1" />
<verse sID="2Tim.1.2" osisID="2Tim.1.2" n="2" />to Timothy, my dear child: may God, the Father, and Christ Jesus, our Lord, bless you, and be merciful to you, and give you peace.
<verse eID="2Tim.1.2" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="2Tim.1.3" osisID="2Tim.1.3" n="3" />I am thankful to God, whom I serve, as my ancestors did, with a clear conscience, when I remember you, as I never fail to do, in my prayers – night and day alike,
<verse eID="2Tim.1.3" />
<verse sID="2Tim.1.4" osisID="2Tim.1.4" n="4" />as I think of your tears, longing to see you, that my happiness may be completed,
<verse eID="2Tim.1.4" />
<verse sID="2Tim.1.5" osisID="2Tim.1.5" n="5" />now that I have been reminded of the sincere faith that you have shown. That faith was seen first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and is now, I am convinced, in you also.
<verse eID="2Tim.1.5" />
<verse sID="2Tim.1.6" osisID="2Tim.1.6" n="6" />And that is my reason for reminding you to stir into flame that gift of God, which is yours through your ordination at my hands.
<verse eID="2Tim.1.6" />
<verse sID="2Tim.1.7" osisID="2Tim.1.7" n="7" />For the Spirit which God gave us was not a spirit of cowardice, but a spirit of power, love, and self-control.
<verse eID="2Tim.1.7" />
<verse sID="2Tim.1.8" osisID="2Tim.1.8" n="8" />Do not, therefore, be ashamed of the testimony which we have to bear to our Lord, or of me imprisoned for his sake; but join with me in suffering for the good news, as far as God enables you.
<verse eID="2Tim.1.8" />
<verse sID="2Tim.1.9" osisID="2Tim.1.9" n="9" />It was God who saved us, and from him we received our solemn call – not as a reward for anything that we had done, but in fulfillment of his own loving purpose. For that love was extended to us, through Christ Jesus, before time began,
<verse eID="2Tim.1.9" />
<verse sID="2Tim.1.10" osisID="2Tim.1.10" n="10" />and has now been made apparent through the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus; who has made an end of death, and has brought life and Immortality to light by that good news,
<verse eID="2Tim.1.10" />
<verse sID="2Tim.1.11" osisID="2Tim.1.11" n="11" />of which I was myself appointed a herald and apostle, and teacher.
<verse eID="2Tim.1.11" />
<verse sID="2Tim.1.12" osisID="2Tim.1.12" n="12" />That is why I am undergoing these sufferings; yet I feel no shame, for I know in whom I have put my faith, and am convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him until that day.
<verse eID="2Tim.1.12" />
<verse sID="2Tim.1.13" osisID="2Tim.1.13" n="13" />Keep before you, as an example of sound teaching, all that you learnt from me as you listened with that faith and love which come from union with Christ Jesus.
<verse eID="2Tim.1.13" />
<verse sID="2Tim.1.14" osisID="2Tim.1.14" n="14" />Guard by the help of the Holy Spirit, who is within us, the glorious trust that has been committed to you.
<verse eID="2Tim.1.14" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="2Tim.1.15" osisID="2Tim.1.15" n="15" />You know, of course, that all our friends in Roman Asia turned their backs on me, including Phygellus and Hermogenes.
<verse eID="2Tim.1.15" />
<verse sID="2Tim.1.16" osisID="2Tim.1.16" n="16" />May the Lord show mercy to the household of Onesiphorus; for he often cheered me and was not ashamed of my chains.
<verse eID="2Tim.1.16" />
<verse sID="2Tim.1.17" osisID="2Tim.1.17" n="17" />On the contrary, when he arrived in Rome, he sought eagerly for me until he found me.
<verse eID="2Tim.1.17" />
<verse sID="2Tim.1.18" osisID="2Tim.1.18" n="18" />The Lord grant that he may find mercy at the hands of the Lord on that day. The many services that he rendered at Ephesus you have the best means of knowing.

<!-- s --><title>Injunctions to Timothy</title>
<p>
<verse sID="2Tim.2.1" osisID="2Tim.2.1" n="1" />You must, then, my child, find strength in the help which comes from the union with Christ Jesus;
<verse eID="2Tim.2.1" />
<verse sID="2Tim.2.2" osisID="2Tim.2.2" n="2" />and what you learnt from me, in the presence of many listeners, entrust to reliable people, who will be able in their turn to teach others.
<verse eID="2Tim.2.2" />
<verse sID="2Tim.2.3" osisID="2Tim.2.3" n="3" />Share hardships with me, as a true soldier of Christ Jesus.
<verse eID="2Tim.2.3" />
<verse sID="2Tim.2.4" osisID="2Tim.2.4" n="4" />A soldier on active service, to please his superior officer, always avoids entangling himself in the affairs of ordinary life.
<verse eID="2Tim.2.4" />
<verse sID="2Tim.2.5" osisID="2Tim.2.5" n="5" />No athlete is ever awarded the wreath of victory unless they have kept the rules.
<verse eID="2Tim.2.5" />
<verse sID="2Tim.2.6" osisID="2Tim.2.6" n="6" />The laborer who does the work should be the first to receive a share of the fruits of the earth.
<verse eID="2Tim.2.6" />
<verse sID="2Tim.2.7" osisID="2Tim.2.7" n="7" />Reflect on what I say; the Lord will always help you to understand.
<verse eID="2Tim.2.7" />
<verse sID="2Tim.2.8" osisID="2Tim.2.8" n="8" />Keep before your mind Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, a descendant of David, as told in the good news entrusted to me;
<verse eID="2Tim.2.8" />
<verse sID="2Tim.2.9" osisID="2Tim.2.9" n="9" />in the service of which I am suffering hardships, even to being put in fetters as a criminal. But the message of God is not fettered;
<verse eID="2Tim.2.9" />
<verse sID="2Tim.2.10" osisID="2Tim.2.10" n="10" />and that is why I submit to anything for the sake of God’s people: so that they also may obtain the salvation which comes from union with Christ Jesus, and imperishable glory.
<verse eID="2Tim.2.10" />
<verse sID="2Tim.2.11" osisID="2Tim.2.11" n="11" />How true this saying is – ‘If we have shared his death, we will also share his life.
<verse eID="2Tim.2.11" />
<verse sID="2Tim.2.12" osisID="2Tim.2.12" n="12" />If we continue to endure, we will also share his throne. If we should ever disown him, he, too, will disown us.
<verse eID="2Tim.2.12" />
<verse sID="2Tim.2.13" osisID="2Tim.2.13" n="13" />If we lose our trust, he is still to be trusted, for he cannot be false to himself!’
<verse eID="2Tim.2.13" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="2Tim.2.14" osisID="2Tim.2.14" n="14" />Remind people of all this; tell them solemnly, as in the sight of God, to avoid controversy, a useless thing and the ruin of those who listen to it.
<verse eID="2Tim.2.14" />
<verse sID="2Tim.2.15" osisID="2Tim.2.15" n="15" />Do your utmost to show yourself true to God, a worker with no reason to be ashamed, accurate in delivering the message of the truth.
<verse eID="2Tim.2.15" />
<verse sID="2Tim.2.16" osisID="2Tim.2.16" n="16" />Avoid profane prattle. Those who indulge in it only get deeper into irreligious ways,
<verse eID="2Tim.2.16" />
<verse sID="2Tim.2.17" osisID="2Tim.2.17" n="17" />and their teaching will spread like a cancer. Hymenaeus and Philetus are instances of this.
<verse eID="2Tim.2.17" />
<verse sID="2Tim.2.18" osisID="2Tim.2.18" n="18" />They have gone completely astray as regards the truth; they say that a resurrection has already taken place, and so upset some people’s faith.
<verse eID="2Tim.2.18" />
<verse sID="2Tim.2.19" osisID="2Tim.2.19" n="19" />Yet God’s firm foundation still stands unmoved, and it bears this inscription –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘THE LORD KNOWS THOSE WHO ARE HIS’;</l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
and this –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘LET ALL THOSE WHO USE THE NAME OF THE LORD TURN AWAY FROM WICKEDNESS.’ <verse eID="2Tim.2.19" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="2Tim.2.20" osisID="2Tim.2.20" n="20" />Now in a large house there are not only things of gold and silver, but also others of wood and earthenware, some for better and some for common use.
<verse eID="2Tim.2.20" />
<verse sID="2Tim.2.21" osisID="2Tim.2.21" n="21" />If, then, a person has escaped from the pollution of such errors as I have mentioned, they will be like a thing kept for better use, set apart, serviceable to its owner, ready for any good purpose.
<verse eID="2Tim.2.21" />
<verse sID="2Tim.2.22" osisID="2Tim.2.22" n="22" />Flee from the passions of youth, but pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, in the company of those who, with a pure heart, invoke the Lord.
<verse eID="2Tim.2.22" />
<verse sID="2Tim.2.23" osisID="2Tim.2.23" n="23" />Shun foolish and ignorant discussions, for you know that they only breed quarrels;
<verse eID="2Tim.2.23" />
<verse sID="2Tim.2.24" osisID="2Tim.2.24" n="24" />and a servant of the Lord should never quarrel. They ought, on the contrary, to be courteous to everyone, skillful teachers, and forbearing.
<verse eID="2Tim.2.24" />
<verse sID="2Tim.2.25" osisID="2Tim.2.25" n="25" />They should instruct their opponents in a gentle spirit; for, possibly, God may give those opponents a repentance that will lead to a fuller knowledge of truth,
<verse eID="2Tim.2.25" />
<verse sID="2Tim.2.26" osisID="2Tim.2.26" n="26" />and they may yet come to a sober mind, and escape from the devil’s net, when captured by the Lord’s servant to do the will of God.
<verse eID="2Tim.2.26" />
<chapter eID="2Tim.2" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="2Tim.3" osisID="2Tim.3" n="3" />
<verse sID="2Tim.3.1" osisID="2Tim.3.1" n="1" />Be sure of this, that in the last days difficult times will come.
<verse eID="2Tim.3.1" />
<verse sID="2Tim.3.2" osisID="2Tim.3.2" n="2" />People will be selfish, mercenary, boastful, haughty, and blasphemous; disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, impure,
<verse eID="2Tim.3.2" />
<verse sID="2Tim.3.3" osisID="2Tim.3.3" n="3" />incapable of affection, merciless, slanderous, wanting in self-control, brutal, careless of the right,
<verse eID="2Tim.3.3" />
<verse sID="2Tim.3.4" osisID="2Tim.3.4" n="4" />treacherous, reckless, and puffed up with pride; they will love pleasure more than they love God;
<verse eID="2Tim.3.4" />
<verse sID="2Tim.3.5" osisID="2Tim.3.5" n="5" />and while they retain the outward form of religion, they will not allow it to influence them. Turn your back on such people as these.
<verse eID="2Tim.3.5" />
<verse sID="2Tim.3.6" osisID="2Tim.3.6" n="6" />For among them are to be found those who creep into homes and captivate weak women – women who, loaded with sins, and slaves to all kinds of passions,
<verse eID="2Tim.3.6" />
<verse sID="2Tim.3.7" osisID="2Tim.3.7" n="7" />are always learning, and yet never able to attain to a real knowledge of the truth.
<verse eID="2Tim.3.7" />
<verse sID="2Tim.3.8" osisID="2Tim.3.8" n="8" />Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so do these people, in their turn, oppose the truth. Their minds are corrupted, and, as regards the faith, they are utterly worthless.
<verse eID="2Tim.3.8" />
<verse sID="2Tim.3.9" osisID="2Tim.3.9" n="9" />They will not, however, make further progress; for their wicked folly will be plain to everyone, just as the folly Jannes and Jambres was.
<verse eID="2Tim.3.9" />
<verse sID="2Tim.3.10" osisID="2Tim.3.10" n="10" />But you, Timothy, were a close observer of my teaching, my conduct, my purposes, my faith, my forbearance, my love, and my patient endurance,
<verse eID="2Tim.3.10" />
<verse sID="2Tim.3.11" osisID="2Tim.3.11" n="11" />as well as of my persecutions, and of the sufferings which I met with at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. You know what persecutions I underwent; and yet the Lord brought me safe out of all!
<verse eID="2Tim.3.11" />
<verse sID="2Tim.3.12" osisID="2Tim.3.12" n="12" />Yes, and all who aim at living a religious life in union with Christ Jesus will have to suffer persecution;
<verse eID="2Tim.3.12" />
<verse sID="2Tim.3.13" osisID="2Tim.3.13" n="13" />but wicked people and impostors will go from bad to worse, deceiving others and deceived themselves.
<verse eID="2Tim.3.13" />
<verse sID="2Tim.3.14" osisID="2Tim.3.14" n="14" />You, however, must stand by what you learnt and accepted as true. You know who they were from whom you learnt it;
<verse eID="2Tim.3.14" />
<verse sID="2Tim.3.15" osisID="2Tim.3.15" n="15" />and that, from your childhood, you have known the sacred writings, which can give you the wisdom that, through belief in Christ Jesus, leads to salvation.
<verse eID="2Tim.3.15" />
<verse sID="2Tim.3.16" osisID="2Tim.3.16" n="16" />All scripture is God-breathed: helpful for teaching, for refuting error, for giving guidance, and for training others in righteousness;
<verse eID="2Tim.3.16" />
<verse sID="2Tim.3.17" osisID="2Tim.3.17" n="17" />so that God’s people may be capable and equipped for good work of every kind.
<verse eID="2Tim.3.17" />
<chapter eID="2Tim.3" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="2Tim.4" osisID="2Tim.4" n="4" />
<verse sID="2Tim.4.1" osisID="2Tim.4.1" n="1" />I solemnly charge you – in the sight of God and of Christ Jesus, who will one day judge the living and the dead – I charge you by his appearing and by his kingdom:
<verse eID="2Tim.4.1" />
<verse sID="2Tim.4.2" osisID="2Tim.4.2" n="2" />Proclaim the message, be ready in season and out of season, convince, rebuke, encourage, never failing to instruct with forbearance.
<verse eID="2Tim.4.2" />
<verse sID="2Tim.4.3" osisID="2Tim.4.3" n="3" />For a time will come when people will not tolerate sound teaching. They will follow their own wishes, and, in their itching for novelty, procure themselves a crowd of teachers.
<verse eID="2Tim.4.3" />
<verse sID="2Tim.4.4" osisID="2Tim.4.4" n="4" />They will turn a deaf ear to the truth, and give their attention to legends instead.
<verse eID="2Tim.4.4" />
<verse sID="2Tim.4.5" osisID="2Tim.4.5" n="5" />But you, Timothy, must always be temperate. Face hardships; do the work of a missionary; discharge all the duties of your office.
<verse eID="2Tim.4.5" />

<p>
<verse sID="2Tim.4.6" osisID="2Tim.4.6" n="6" />As for me, my life blood is already being poured out; the time of my departure is close at hand.

<verse sID="2Tim.4.10" osisID="2Tim.4.10" n="10" />for Demas, in his love for the world, has deserted me. He has gone to Thessalonica, Crescens to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.
<verse eID="2Tim.4.10" />
<verse sID="2Tim.4.11" osisID="2Tim.4.11" n="11" />There is no one but Luke with me. Pick up Mark on your way, and bring him with you, for he is useful to me in my work.

<verse sID="2Tim.4.14" osisID="2Tim.4.14" n="14" />Alexander, the coppersmith, showed much ill feeling towards me. The Lord will give him what his actions deserve.
<verse eID="2Tim.4.14" />
<verse sID="2Tim.4.15" osisID="2Tim.4.15" n="15" />You must also on your guard against him, for he is strongly opposed to our teaching.
<verse eID="2Tim.4.15" />
<verse sID="2Tim.4.16" osisID="2Tim.4.16" n="16" />At my first trial no one stood by me. They all deserted me. May it never be counted against them!
<verse eID="2Tim.4.16" />
<verse sID="2Tim.4.17" osisID="2Tim.4.17" n="17" />But the Lord came to my help and strengthened me, in order that, through me, the proclamation should be made so widely that all the Gentiles should hear it; and I was rescued out of the lion’s mouth.

<!-- s --><title>Introduction</title>
<p>
<verse sID="Titus.1.1" osisID="Titus.1.1" n="1" />From Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, on behalf of the faith of God’s chosen people, and their knowledge of that truth which makes for godliness
<verse eID="Titus.1.1" />
<verse sID="Titus.1.2" osisID="Titus.1.2" n="2" />– and is based on the hope of eternal life, which God, who never lies, promised before the ages began,
<verse eID="Titus.1.2" />
<verse sID="Titus.1.3" osisID="Titus.1.3" n="3" />and has revealed at his own time in his message, with the preaching of which I was entrusted by the command of God our Savior.
<verse eID="Titus.1.3" />
<verse sID="Titus.1.4" osisID="Titus.1.4" n="4" />To Titus, my true child in our shared faith: May God, the Father, and Christ Jesus, our Savior, bless you and give you peace.
</p>
<verse eID="Titus.1.4" />
<!-- s --><title>Mission of Titus in Crete</title>
<p>
<verse sID="Titus.1.5" osisID="Titus.1.5" n="5" />My reason for leaving you in Crete was that you might put in order what had been left unfinished, and appoint church elders in the various towns, as I myself directed you.
<verse eID="Titus.1.5" />
<verse sID="Titus.1.6" osisID="Titus.1.6" n="6" />They are to be of irreproachable character, faithful to their partners, whose children are believers in Christ and have never been open to the charge of being wild or unruly.
<verse eID="Titus.1.6" />
<verse sID="Titus.1.7" osisID="Titus.1.7" n="7" />For a supervisor, as God’s steward, ought to be of blameless character – not arrogant or quick-tempered, not given to drunkeness, violence or shady money-making.
<verse eID="Titus.1.7" />
<verse sID="Titus.1.8" osisID="Titus.1.8" n="8" />Instead, they should be hospitable, love what is good, self-controlled, upright, people of holy life and disciplined,
<verse eID="Titus.1.8" />
<verse sID="Titus.1.9" osisID="Titus.1.9" n="9" />holding firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught – so that they may be able to encourage others by sound teaching, as well as to refute those who contradict it.
<verse eID="Titus.1.9" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Titus.1.10" osisID="Titus.1.10" n="10" />For there are many undisciplined persons who lead others astray with their nonsense, especially those of the group advocating the necessity of circumcision.
<verse eID="Titus.1.10" />
<verse sID="Titus.1.11" osisID="Titus.1.11" n="11" />They need to be kept quiet as they disrupt whole households by teaching what they ought not to teach, simply to make shameful financial gain.
<verse eID="Titus.1.11" />
<verse sID="Titus.1.12" osisID="Titus.1.12" n="12" />It was a Cretan – one of their own prophets – who said: ‘Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and lazy gluttons.’ This statement is true.
<verse eID="Titus.1.12" />
<verse sID="Titus.1.13" osisID="Titus.1.13" n="13" />Therefore rebuke them sharply, so that they may be sound in the faith,
<verse eID="Titus.1.13" />
<verse sID="Titus.1.14" osisID="Titus.1.14" n="14" />and may pay no attention to Jewish legends, or to the directions of those who turn their backs on the truth.
<verse eID="Titus.1.14" />
<verse sID="Titus.1.15" osisID="Titus.1.15" n="15" />To those whose minds are pure, all things are ritually pure, but to those whose minds are tainted and unbelieving nothing is pure, as their minds and consciences are alike polluted.
<verse eID="Titus.1.15" />
<verse sID="Titus.1.16" osisID="Titus.1.16" n="16" />They claim to know God, but by their actions they deny him. They are detestable and disobedient and useless for any good work.
<verse eID="Titus.1.16" />

</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Titus.2" osisID="Titus.2" n="2" />
<verse sID="Titus.2.1" osisID="Titus.2.1" n="1" />You however, should speak of such subjects as properly have a place in sound teaching.
<verse eID="Titus.2.1" />
<verse sID="Titus.2.2" osisID="Titus.2.2" n="2" />Teach that the older men should be soberly clear minded, dignified and self-controlled – sound in faith, love, and patient endurance.
<verse eID="Titus.2.2" />
<verse sID="Titus.2.3" osisID="Titus.2.3" n="3" />So, too, that the older women should live reverent lives, not slanderers, not slaves to excessive drinking.
<verse eID="Titus.2.3" />
<verse sID="Titus.2.4" osisID="Titus.2.4" n="4" />They should teach what is good, so as to train the younger women to love their husbands and children,
<verse eID="Titus.2.4" />
<verse sID="Titus.2.5" osisID="Titus.2.5" n="5" />and to be self-controlled, pure-minded, to be watching over their home, to be kind, respecting the authority of their husbands, so that no one will speak badly of God’s message.
<verse eID="Titus.2.5" />
<verse sID="Titus.2.6" osisID="Titus.2.6" n="6" />In the same way with the younger men – encourage them to be self-controlled.
<verse eID="Titus.2.6" />
<verse sID="Titus.2.7" osisID="Titus.2.7" n="7" />In all things, set an example of doing good. In your teaching, show integrity and seriousness –
<verse eID="Titus.2.7" />
<verse sID="Titus.2.8" osisID="Titus.2.8" n="8" />let the instruction that you give be sound and above reproach, so that those who oppose you may be ashamed when they fail to find anything bad to say about us.
<verse eID="Titus.2.8" />
<verse sID="Titus.2.9" osisID="Titus.2.9" n="9" />Tell slaves to respect their owner’s authority in all circumstances, and to try their best to please them.
<verse eID="Titus.2.9" />
<verse sID="Titus.2.10" osisID="Titus.2.10" n="10" />Teach them not to contradict or to pilfer, but to show such praiseworthy fidelity in everything, as to recommend the teaching about God our Savior by all that they do.
<verse eID="Titus.2.10" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Titus.2.11" osisID="Titus.2.11" n="11" />For the loving kindness of God has been revealed, bringing salvation for all,
<verse eID="Titus.2.11" />
<verse sID="Titus.2.12" osisID="Titus.2.12" n="12" />leading us to renounce ungodliness and worldly desires, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives here in this present age,
<verse eID="Titus.2.12" />
<verse sID="Titus.2.13" osisID="Titus.2.13" n="13" />while awaiting our blessed hope – the appearing in glory of our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus.
<verse eID="Titus.2.13" />
<verse sID="Titus.2.14" osisID="Titus.2.14" n="14" />For he gave himself on our behalf, to deliver us from all wickedness, and to purify for himself a people who should be truly his own and eager to do good.
<verse eID="Titus.2.14" />
<verse sID="Titus.2.15" osisID="Titus.2.15" n="15" />Tell them of all this, and encourage and rebuke with all authority. Do not let anyone belittle you.
<verse eID="Titus.2.15" />
<chapter eID="Titus.2" />
<chapter sID="Titus.3" osisID="Titus.3" n="3" />
<verse sID="Titus.3.1" osisID="Titus.3.1" n="1" />Remind them to respect and obey the rulers and authorities, to be ready for every kind of good work, to slander no one, to avoid quarreling,
<verse eID="Titus.3.1" />
<verse sID="Titus.3.2" osisID="Titus.3.2" n="2" />to be reasonable, and under all circumstances to show a gentle spirit with all.
<verse eID="Titus.3.2" />
<verse sID="Titus.3.3" osisID="Titus.3.3" n="3" />There was a time when we ourselves were foolish, disobedient, misled, enslaved to all kinds of desires and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hating ourselves and hating one another.
<verse eID="Titus.3.3" />
<verse sID="Titus.3.4" osisID="Titus.3.4" n="4" />But, when the kindness of God our Savior and his love for humanity appeared, he saved us,
<verse eID="Titus.3.4" />
<verse sID="Titus.3.5" osisID="Titus.3.5" n="5" />not as the result of any righteous actions that we had done, but due to his mercy. He saved us though the washing of rebirth and renewal by the power of the Holy Spirit,
<verse eID="Titus.3.5" />
<verse sID="Titus.3.6" osisID="Titus.3.6" n="6" />which he poured out on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior –
<verse eID="Titus.3.6" />
<verse sID="Titus.3.7" osisID="Titus.3.7" n="7" />so that, having been put right with God through his grace, we become heirs to the hope of eternal life.
<verse eID="Titus.3.7" />
<verse sID="Titus.3.8" osisID="Titus.3.8" n="8" />This saying is trustworthy! And it is on these subjects that I want you to lay special emphasis, so that those who have learned to trust in God may be careful to devote themselves to doing good. Such subjects are excellent in themselves, and of benefit to all.
<verse eID="Titus.3.8" />
<verse sID="Titus.3.9" osisID="Titus.3.9" n="9" />But have nothing to do with foolish controversies, or with genealogies, or with quarrels, or fights about the Law. They are useless and futile.
<verse eID="Titus.3.9" />
<verse sID="Titus.3.10" osisID="Titus.3.10" n="10" />If someone is causing divisions among you then, after giving them a second warning, excuse yourself from them.
<verse eID="Titus.3.10" />
<verse sID="Titus.3.11" osisID="Titus.3.11" n="11" />You can be sure that such a person has forsaken the truth and is in the wrong. They stand self-condemned.

<verse eID="Titus.3.11" />
<!-- s --><title>Conclusion</title>

<verse sID="Titus.3.12" osisID="Titus.3.12" n="12" />As soon as I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, join me as quickly as possible at Nicopolis, for I have arranged to spend the winter there.
<verse eID="Titus.3.12" />
<verse sID="Titus.3.13" osisID="Titus.3.13" n="13" />Do your best to help Zenas, the teacher of the Law, and Apollos, on their way, and see that they want for nothing.

</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Heb.1.13" osisID="Heb.1.13" n="13" />To which of the angels has God ever said –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘Sit you at my right hand</l>
<l level="2">until I put your enemies as a stool for your feet’? <verse eID="Heb.1.13" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Heb.1.14" osisID="Heb.1.14" n="14" />Are not all the angels spirits in the service of God, sent out to minister for the sake of those who are destined to obtain salvation?
<verse eID="Heb.1.14" />
<chapter eID="Heb.1" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Heb.2" osisID="Heb.2" n="2" />
<verse sID="Heb.2.1" osisID="Heb.2.1" n="1" />Therefore we must give still more heed to what we were taught, so we do not drift away.
<verse eID="Heb.2.1" />
<verse sID="Heb.2.2" osisID="Heb.2.2" n="2" />For, if the message which was delivered by angels had its authority confirmed, so that every offense against it, or neglect of it, met with a fitting requital,
<verse eID="Heb.2.2" />
<verse sID="Heb.2.3" osisID="Heb.2.3" n="3" />how can we, of all people, expect to escape, if we disregard so great a salvation? It was the Master who at the outset spoke of this salvation, and its authority was confirmed for us by those who heard him,
<verse eID="Heb.2.3" />
<verse sID="Heb.2.4" osisID="Heb.2.4" n="4" />while God himself added his testimony to it by signs, and marvels, and many different miracles, as well as by imparting the Holy Spirit as he saw fit.
<verse eID="Heb.2.4" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Heb.2.5" osisID="Heb.2.5" n="5" />God has not given to angels the control of that future world of which we are speaking!
<verse eID="Heb.2.5" />
<verse sID="Heb.2.6" osisID="Heb.2.6" n="6" />No; a writer has declared somewhere –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘What are mere mortals that you should remember them?</l>
<l level="2">Or human beings that you should care for them? <verse eID="Heb.2.6" /></l>
<l level="1">
<verse sID="Heb.2.7" osisID="Heb.2.7" n="7" />You have made them, for a while, lower than angels;</l>
<l level="2">with glory and honor you have crowned them;</l>
<l level="1">you have set them over all that your hands have made; <verse eID="Heb.2.7" /></l>
<l level="2">
<verse sID="Heb.2.8" osisID="Heb.2.8" n="8" />you have placed all things beneath their feet.’ </l>
</lg>
<lb type="x-p" />
<p type="x-noindent">
This ‘placing of everything’ under humanity means that there was nothing which was not placed under them. As yet, however, we do not see everything placed under humanity.
<verse eID="Heb.2.8" />
<verse sID="Heb.2.9" osisID="Heb.2.9" n="9" />What our eyes do see is Jesus, who was made for a while lower than angels, now, because of his sufferings and death, crowned with glory and honor; so that his tasting the bitterness of death should, in God’s loving kindness, be on behalf of all humanity.
<verse eID="Heb.2.9" />
<verse sID="Heb.2.10" osisID="Heb.2.10" n="10" />It was, indeed, fitting that God, for whom and through whom all things exist, should, when leading many children to glory, make the author of their salvation perfect through suffering.
<verse eID="Heb.2.10" />
<verse sID="Heb.2.11" osisID="Heb.2.11" n="11" />For he who purifies, and those whom he purifies, all spring from One; and therefore he is not ashamed to call them his brothers and sisters.
<verse eID="Heb.2.11" />
<verse sID="Heb.2.12" osisID="Heb.2.12" n="12" />He says –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘I will tell of your name to my brothers and sisters,</l>
<l level="1">in the midst of the congregation I will sing your praise.’ <verse eID="Heb.2.12" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Heb.2.13" osisID="Heb.2.13" n="13" />And again –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘As for me, I will put my trust in God.’ </l>
</lg>
<lb type="x-p" />
<p type="x-noindent">
And yet again –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘See, here am I and the children whom God gave me.’ <verse eID="Heb.2.13" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Heb.2.14" osisID="Heb.2.14" n="14" />Therefore, since human nature is the common heritage of the children, Jesus also shared it, in order that by death he might render powerless him whose power lies in death – that is, the devil –
<verse eID="Heb.2.14" />
<verse sID="Heb.2.15" osisID="Heb.2.15" n="15" />and so might deliver all those who, from fear of death, had all their lives been living in slavery.
<verse eID="Heb.2.15" />
<verse sID="Heb.2.16" osisID="Heb.2.16" n="16" />It was not, surely, to the help of the angels that Jesus came, but to the help of the descendants of Abraham.
<verse eID="Heb.2.16" />
<verse sID="Heb.2.17" osisID="Heb.2.17" n="17" />And consequently it was necessary that he should in all points be made like his brothers and sisters, in order that he might prove a merciful as well as a faithful high priest in humanity’s relations with God, for the purpose of expiating the sins of his people.
<verse eID="Heb.2.17" />
<verse sID="Heb.2.18" osisID="Heb.2.18" n="18" />The fact that he himself suffered under temptation enables him to help those who are tempted.
<verse eID="Heb.2.18" />
<chapter eID="Heb.2" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Heb.3" osisID="Heb.3" n="3" />
<verse sID="Heb.3.1" osisID="Heb.3.1" n="1" />Therefore, my Christian friends, you who, all alike, have received the call from heaven, fix your attention on Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our religion.
<verse eID="Heb.3.1" />
<verse sID="Heb.3.2" osisID="Heb.3.2" n="2" />See how faithful he was to the God who appointed him, as Moses was in the whole house of God.
<verse eID="Heb.3.2" />
<verse sID="Heb.3.3" osisID="Heb.3.3" n="3" />He has been deemed worthy of far higher honor than Moses, just as the founder of the house is held in greater regard than the house itself.
<verse eID="Heb.3.3" />
<verse sID="Heb.3.4" osisID="Heb.3.4" n="4" />For every house has its founder, and the founder of the universe is God.
<verse eID="Heb.3.4" />
<verse sID="Heb.3.5" osisID="Heb.3.5" n="5" />While the faithful service of Moses in the whole house of God was that of a servant, whose duty was to bear testimony to a message still to come,
<verse eID="Heb.3.5" />
<verse sID="Heb.3.6" osisID="Heb.3.6" n="6" />the faithfulness of Christ was that of a son set over the house of God. And we are his house – if only we retain, unshaken to the end, the courage and confidence inspired by our hope.
<verse eID="Heb.3.6" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Heb.3.7" osisID="Heb.3.7" n="7" />Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘If today you hear God’s voice, <verse eID="Heb.3.7" /></l>
<l level="1">
<verse sID="Heb.3.8" osisID="Heb.3.8" n="8" />harden not your hearts, as when Israel provoked me</l>
<l level="2">on the day when they tried my patience in the desert, <verse eID="Heb.3.8" /></l>
<l level="1">
<verse sID="Heb.3.9" osisID="Heb.3.9" n="9" />Where your ancestors tried my forbearance,</l>
<l level="2">and saw my mighty deeds for forty years. <verse eID="Heb.3.9" /></l>
<l level="1">
<verse sID="Heb.3.10" osisID="Heb.3.10" n="10" />Therefore I was sorely vexed with that generation,</l>
<l level="1">and I said – “Their hearts are always straying;</l>
<l level="2">they have never learned my ways”; <verse eID="Heb.3.10" /></l>
<l level="1">
<verse sID="Heb.3.11" osisID="Heb.3.11" n="11" />While in my wrath I swore –</l>
<l level="2">“They will never enter upon my rest.”’ <verse eID="Heb.3.11" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Heb.3.12" osisID="Heb.3.12" n="12" />Be careful, friends, that there is never found in anyone of you a wicked and faithless heart, shown by that person separating themselves from the living God.
<verse eID="Heb.3.12" />
<verse sID="Heb.3.13" osisID="Heb.3.13" n="13" />Rather encourage one another daily – while there is a today – to prevent anyone among you from being hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.
<verse eID="Heb.3.13" />
<verse sID="Heb.3.14" osisID="Heb.3.14" n="14" />For we now all share in the Christ, if indeed we retain, unshaken to the end, the confidence that we had at the first.
<verse eID="Heb.3.14" />
<verse sID="Heb.3.15" osisID="Heb.3.15" n="15" />To use the words of scripture –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘If today you hear God’s voice,</l>
<l level="1">harden not your hearts, as when Israel provoked me.’ <verse eID="Heb.3.15" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Heb.3.16" osisID="Heb.3.16" n="16" />Who were they who heard God speak and yet provoked him? Were not they all those who left Egypt under the leadership of Moses?
<verse eID="Heb.3.16" />
<verse sID="Heb.3.17" osisID="Heb.3.17" n="17" />And with whom was it that God was sorely vexed for forty years? Was not it with those who had sinned, and who fell dead in the desert?
<verse eID="Heb.3.17" />
<verse sID="Heb.3.18" osisID="Heb.3.18" n="18" />And who were they to whom God swore that they should not enter upon his rest, if not those who had proved faithless?
<verse eID="Heb.3.18" />
<verse sID="Heb.3.19" osisID="Heb.3.19" n="19" />We see, then, that they failed to enter upon it because of their want of faith.
<verse eID="Heb.3.19" />
<chapter eID="Heb.3" />
<chapter sID="Heb.4" osisID="Heb.4" n="4" />
<verse sID="Heb.4.1" osisID="Heb.4.1" n="1" />We must, therefore, be very careful, though there is a promise still standing that we will enter upon God’s rest, that none of you even appear to have missed it.
<verse eID="Heb.4.1" />
<verse sID="Heb.4.2" osisID="Heb.4.2" n="2" />For we have had the good news told us just as they had. But the message which they heard did them no good, since they did not share the faith of those who were attentive to it.
<verse eID="Heb.4.2" />
<verse sID="Heb.4.3" osisID="Heb.4.3" n="3" />Upon that rest we who have believed are now entering. As God has said –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘In my wrath I swore –</l>
<l level="2">“They will never enter upon my rest;”’ </l>
</lg>
<lb type="x-p" />
<p type="x-noindent">
Although God’s work was finished at the creation of the world;
<verse eID="Heb.4.3" />
<verse sID="Heb.4.4" osisID="Heb.4.4" n="4" />for, in a passage referring to the seventh day, you will find these words –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘God rested on the seventh day after all his work.’ <verse eID="Heb.4.4" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Heb.4.5" osisID="Heb.4.5" n="5" />On the other hand, we read in that passage –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘They will never enter upon my rest.’ <verse eID="Heb.4.5" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Heb.4.6" osisID="Heb.4.6" n="6" />Since, then, there is still a promise that some will enter upon this rest, and since those who were first told the good news did not enter upon it, because of their disbelief,
<verse eID="Heb.4.6" />
<verse sID="Heb.4.7" osisID="Heb.4.7" n="7" />again God fixed a day. ‘Today,’ he said, speaking after a long interval through the mouth of David, in the passage already quoted –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘If today you hear God’s voice</l>
<l level="1">harden not your hearts.’ <verse eID="Heb.4.7" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Heb.4.8" osisID="Heb.4.8" n="8" />Now if Joshua had given ‘rest’ to the people, God would not have spoken of another and later day.
<verse eID="Heb.4.8" />
<verse sID="Heb.4.9" osisID="Heb.4.9" n="9" />There is, then, a Sabbath rest still awaiting God’s people.
<verse eID="Heb.4.9" />
<verse sID="Heb.4.10" osisID="Heb.4.10" n="10" />For the person who enters upon God’s rest do themselves rest after their work, just as God did.
<verse eID="Heb.4.10" />
<verse sID="Heb.4.11" osisID="Heb.4.11" n="11" />Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter upon that rest, so that none of us fall through such disbelief as that of which we have had an example.
<verse eID="Heb.4.11" />
<verse sID="Heb.4.12" osisID="Heb.4.12" n="12" />God’s message is a living and active power, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing its way until it penetrates soul and spirit – not the joints only but the marrow – and detecting the inmost thoughts and purposes of the mind.
<verse eID="Heb.4.12" />
<verse sID="Heb.4.13" osisID="Heb.4.13" n="13" />There is no created thing that can hide itself from the sight of God. Everything is exposed and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we have to give account.
<verse eID="Heb.4.13" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Heb.4.14" osisID="Heb.4.14" n="14" />We have, then, in Jesus, the Son of God, a great high priest who has passed into the highest heaven; let us, therefore, hold fast to the faith which we have professed.
<verse eID="Heb.4.14" />
<verse sID="Heb.4.15" osisID="Heb.4.15" n="15" />Our high priest is not one unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who has in every way been tempted, exactly as we have been, but without sinning.
<verse eID="Heb.4.15" />
<verse sID="Heb.4.16" osisID="Heb.4.16" n="16" />Therefore, let us draw near boldly to the throne of love, to find pity and love for the hour of need.
<verse eID="Heb.4.16" />
<chapter eID="Heb.4" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Heb.5" osisID="Heb.5" n="5" />
<verse sID="Heb.5.1" osisID="Heb.5.1" n="1" />Every high priest, taken from among the people, is appointed as their representative in their relations with God, to offer both gifts and sacrifices in expiation of sins.
<verse eID="Heb.5.1" />
<verse sID="Heb.5.2" osisID="Heb.5.2" n="2" />And he is able to sympathize with the ignorant and deluded, since he is himself subject to weakness,
<verse eID="Heb.5.2" />
<verse sID="Heb.5.3" osisID="Heb.5.3" n="3" />and is therefore bound to offer sacrifices for sins, not only for the people, but equally so for himself.
<verse eID="Heb.5.3" />
<verse sID="Heb.5.4" osisID="Heb.5.4" n="4" />Nor does anyone take that high office on themselves, until they have been called to do so by God, as Aaron was.
<verse eID="Heb.5.4" />
<verse sID="Heb.5.5" osisID="Heb.5.5" n="5" />In the same way, even the Christ did not take the honor of the high priesthood on himself, but he was appointed by him who said to him –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘You are my Son; this day I have become your Father’; <verse eID="Heb.5.5" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Heb.5.6" osisID="Heb.5.6" n="6" />and on another occasion also –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘You are a priest for all time of the order of Melchizedek.’ <verse eID="Heb.5.6" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Heb.5.7" osisID="Heb.5.7" n="7" />Jesus, in the days of his earthly life, offered prayers and supplications, with earnest cries and with tears, to him who was able to save him from death; and he was heard because of his devout submission.
<verse eID="Heb.5.7" />
<verse sID="Heb.5.8" osisID="Heb.5.8" n="8" />Son though he was, he learned obedience from his sufferings;
<verse eID="Heb.5.8" />
<verse sID="Heb.5.9" osisID="Heb.5.9" n="9" />and, being made perfect, he became to all those who obey him the source of eternal salvation,
<verse eID="Heb.5.9" />
<verse sID="Heb.5.10" osisID="Heb.5.10" n="10" />while God himself pronounced him a high priest of the order of Melchizedek.
<verse eID="Heb.5.10" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Heb.5.11" osisID="Heb.5.11" n="11" />Now on this subject I have much to say, but it is difficult to explain it to you, because you have shown yourselves so slow to learn.
<verse eID="Heb.5.11" />
<verse sID="Heb.5.12" osisID="Heb.5.12" n="12" />For whereas, considering the time that has elapsed, you ought to be teaching others, you still need someone to teach you the alphabet of the divine revelation, and need again to be fed with milk instead of with ‘solid food.’
<verse eID="Heb.5.12" />
<verse sID="Heb.5.13" osisID="Heb.5.13" n="13" />For everyone who still has to take milk knows nothing of the teaching of righteousness; they are a mere infant.
<verse eID="Heb.5.13" />
<verse sID="Heb.5.14" osisID="Heb.5.14" n="14" />But solid food is for Christians of mature faith – those whose faculties have been trained by practice to distinguish right from wrong.
<verse eID="Heb.5.14" />
<chapter eID="Heb.5" />
<chapter sID="Heb.6" osisID="Heb.6" n="6" />
<verse sID="Heb.6.1" osisID="Heb.6.1" n="1" />Therefore, let us leave behind the elementary teaching about the Christ and press on to perfection, not always laying over again a foundation of repentance for a lifeless formality, of faith in God –
<verse eID="Heb.6.1" />
<verse sID="Heb.6.2" osisID="Heb.6.2" n="2" />teaching concerning baptisms and the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead and a final judgment.
<verse eID="Heb.6.2" />
<verse sID="Heb.6.3" osisID="Heb.6.3" n="3" />Yes and, with God’s help, we will.
<verse eID="Heb.6.3" />
<verse sID="Heb.6.4" osisID="Heb.6.4" n="4" />For if those who were once for all brought into the light, and learned to appreciate the gift from heaven, and came to share in the Holy Spirit,
<verse eID="Heb.6.4" />
<verse sID="Heb.6.5" osisID="Heb.6.5" n="5" />and learned to appreciate the beauty of the divine message, and the new powers of the coming age –
<verse eID="Heb.6.5" />
<verse sID="Heb.6.6" osisID="Heb.6.6" n="6" />if those, I say, fell away, it would be impossible to bring them again to repentance; they would be crucifying the Son of God over again for themselves, and exposing him to open contempt.
<verse eID="Heb.6.6" />
<verse sID="Heb.6.7" osisID="Heb.6.7" n="7" />Ground that drinks in the showers that from time to time fall on it, and produces vegetation useful to those for whom it is tilled, receives a blessing from God;
<verse eID="Heb.6.7" />
<verse sID="Heb.6.8" osisID="Heb.6.8" n="8" />but, if it bears thorns and thistles, it is regarded as worthless, it is in danger of being cursed, and its end will be the fire.
<verse eID="Heb.6.8" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Heb.6.9" osisID="Heb.6.9" n="9" />But about you, dear friends, even though we speak in this way, we are confident of better things – of things that point to your salvation.
<verse eID="Heb.6.9" />
<verse sID="Heb.6.10" osisID="Heb.6.10" n="10" />For God is not unjust; he will not forget the work that you did, and the love that you showed for his name, in sending help to your fellow Christians – as you are still doing.
<verse eID="Heb.6.10" />
<verse sID="Heb.6.11" osisID="Heb.6.11" n="11" />But our great desire is that every one of you should be equally earnest to attain to a full conviction that our hope will be fulfilled, and that you should keep that hope to the end.
<verse eID="Heb.6.11" />
<verse sID="Heb.6.12" osisID="Heb.6.12" n="12" />Then you will not show yourselves slow to learn, but you will copy those who, through faith and patience, are now entering upon the enjoyment of God’s promises.
<verse eID="Heb.6.12" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Heb.6.13" osisID="Heb.6.13" n="13" />When God gave his promise to Abraham, since there was no one greater by whom he could swear, he swore by himself.
<verse eID="Heb.6.13" />
<verse sID="Heb.6.14" osisID="Heb.6.14" n="14" />His words were –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘I will assuredly bless you and increase your numbers.’ <verse eID="Heb.6.14" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Heb.6.15" osisID="Heb.6.15" n="15" />And so, after patiently waiting, Abraham obtained the fulfillment of God’s promise.
<verse eID="Heb.6.15" />
<verse sID="Heb.6.16" osisID="Heb.6.16" n="16" />People, of course, swear by what is greater than themselves, and with them an oath is accepted as putting a matter beyond all dispute.
<verse eID="Heb.6.16" />
<verse sID="Heb.6.17" osisID="Heb.6.17" n="17" />And therefore God, in his desire to show, with unmistakable plainness, to those who were to enter on the enjoyment of what he had promised, the unchangeableness of his purpose, bound himself with an oath.
<verse eID="Heb.6.17" />
<verse sID="Heb.6.18" osisID="Heb.6.18" n="18" />For he intended us to find great encouragement in these two unchangeable things, which make it impossible for God to prove false – we, I mean, who fled for safety where we might lay hold on the hope set before us.
<verse eID="Heb.6.18" />
<verse sID="Heb.6.19" osisID="Heb.6.19" n="19" />This hope is an anchor for our souls, secure and strong, and it reaches into the sanctuary that lies behind the curtain,
<verse eID="Heb.6.19" />
<verse sID="Heb.6.20" osisID="Heb.6.20" n="20" />where Jesus, our forerunner, has entered on our behalf, after being made for all time a high priest of the order of Melchizedek.

<verse sID="Heb.7.1" osisID="Heb.7.1" n="1" />It was this Melchizedek, king of Salem and priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and gave him his blessing;
<verse eID="Heb.7.1" />
<verse sID="Heb.7.2" osisID="Heb.7.2" n="2" />and it was to him that Abraham allotted a tithe of all the spoil. The meaning of his name is ‘king of righteousness,’ and besides that, he was also king of Salem, which means ‘king of peace.’
<verse eID="Heb.7.2" />
<verse sID="Heb.7.3" osisID="Heb.7.3" n="3" />There is no record of his father, or mother, or lineage, nor again of any beginning of his days, or end of his life. In this he resembles the Son of God, and stands before us as a priest whose priesthood is continuous.
<verse eID="Heb.7.3" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Heb.7.4" osisID="Heb.7.4" n="4" />Consider, then the importance of this Melchizedek, to whom even the patriarch Abraham himself gave a tithe of the choicest spoils.
<verse eID="Heb.7.4" />
<verse sID="Heb.7.5" osisID="Heb.7.5" n="5" />Those descendants of Levi, who are from time to time appointed to the priesthood, are directed to collect tithes from the people in accordance with the Law – that is from their own kindred, although they also are descended from Abraham.
<verse eID="Heb.7.5" />
<verse sID="Heb.7.6" osisID="Heb.7.6" n="6" />But Melchizedek, although not of this lineage, received tithes from Abraham, and gave his blessing to the man who had God’s promises.
<verse eID="Heb.7.6" />
<verse sID="Heb.7.7" osisID="Heb.7.7" n="7" />Now no one can dispute that it is the superior who blesses the inferior.
<verse eID="Heb.7.7" />
<verse sID="Heb.7.8" osisID="Heb.7.8" n="8" />In the one case the tithes are received by people who are mortal; in the other case by one about whom there is the statement that his life still continues.
<verse eID="Heb.7.8" />
<verse sID="Heb.7.9" osisID="Heb.7.9" n="9" />Moreover, in a sense, even Levi, who is the receiver of the tithes, has, through Abraham, paid tithes;
<verse eID="Heb.7.9" />
<verse sID="Heb.7.10" osisID="Heb.7.10" n="10" />for Levi was still in the body of his ancestor when Melchizedek met Abraham.
<verse eID="Heb.7.10" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Heb.7.11" osisID="Heb.7.11" n="11" />If, then, perfection had been attainable through the Levitical priesthood – and it was under this priesthood that the people received the Law – why was it still necessary that a priest of a different order should appear, a priest of the order of Melchizedek and not of the order of Aaron?
<verse eID="Heb.7.11" />
<verse sID="Heb.7.12" osisID="Heb.7.12" n="12" />With the change of the priesthood a change of the Law became a necessity.
<verse eID="Heb.7.12" />
<verse sID="Heb.7.13" osisID="Heb.7.13" n="13" />And he of whom all this is said belonged to quite a different tribe, no member of which has ever served at the altar.
<verse eID="Heb.7.13" />
<verse sID="Heb.7.14" osisID="Heb.7.14" n="14" />For it is plain that our Lord had sprung from the tribe of Judah, though of that tribe Moses said nothing about their being priests.
<verse eID="Heb.7.14" />
<verse sID="Heb.7.15" osisID="Heb.7.15" n="15" />All this becomes even yet plainer when we remember that a new priest has appeared, resembling Melchizedek,
<verse eID="Heb.7.15" />
<verse sID="Heb.7.16" osisID="Heb.7.16" n="16" />and that he was appointed, not under a Law regulating only earthly matters, but by virtue of a life beyond the reach of death;
<verse eID="Heb.7.16" />
<verse sID="Heb.7.17" osisID="Heb.7.17" n="17" />for that is the meaning of the declaration –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘You are for all time a priest of the order of Melchizedek.’ <verse eID="Heb.7.17" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Heb.7.18" osisID="Heb.7.18" n="18" />On the one hand, we have the abolition of a previous regulation as being both inefficient and useless
<verse eID="Heb.7.18" />
<verse sID="Heb.7.19" osisID="Heb.7.19" n="19" />(for the Law never brought anything to perfection); and, on the other hand, we have the introduction of a better hope, which enables us to draw near to God.
<verse eID="Heb.7.19" />
<verse sID="Heb.7.20" osisID="Heb.7.20" n="20" />Then again, the appointment of this new priest was ratified by an oath, which is not so with the Levitical priests,
<verse eID="Heb.7.20" />
<verse sID="Heb.7.21" osisID="Heb.7.21" n="21" />but his appointment was ratified by an oath, when God said to him –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘The Lord has sworn, and will not change, “You are a priest for all time.”’ <verse eID="Heb.7.21" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Heb.7.22" osisID="Heb.7.22" n="22" />And the oath shows the corresponding superiority of the covenant of which Jesus is appointed the surety.
<verse eID="Heb.7.22" />
<verse sID="Heb.7.23" osisID="Heb.7.23" n="23" />Again, new Levitical priests are continually being appointed, because death prevents their remaining in office;
<verse eID="Heb.7.23" />
<verse sID="Heb.7.24" osisID="Heb.7.24" n="24" />but Jesus remains for all time, and therefore the priesthood that he holds will never pass to another.
<verse eID="Heb.7.24" />
<verse sID="Heb.7.25" osisID="Heb.7.25" n="25" />And that is why he is able to save perfectly those who come to God through him, living for ever, as he does, to intercede of their behalf.
<verse eID="Heb.7.25" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Heb.7.26" osisID="Heb.7.26" n="26" />This was the high priest that we needed – holy, innocent, spotless, withdrawn from sinners, exalted above the highest heaven,
<verse eID="Heb.7.26" />
<verse sID="Heb.7.27" osisID="Heb.7.27" n="27" />one who has no need to offer sacrifices daily as those high priests have, first for their own sins, and then for those of the people. For this he did once and for all, when he offered himself as the sacrifice.
<verse eID="Heb.7.27" />
<verse sID="Heb.7.28" osisID="Heb.7.28" n="28" />The Law appoints as high priests men who are weak, but the words of God’s oath, which was later than the Law, name the Son as, for all time, the perfect priest.
<verse eID="Heb.7.28" />
<chapter eID="Heb.7" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Heb.8" osisID="Heb.8" n="8" />
<verse sID="Heb.8.1" osisID="Heb.8.1" n="1" />To sum up what I have been saying: Such is the high priest that we have, one who has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of God’s Majesty in heaven,
<verse eID="Heb.8.1" />
<verse sID="Heb.8.2" osisID="Heb.8.2" n="2" />where he serves in the sanctuary, in that true tent set up by the Lord and not by man.
<verse eID="Heb.8.2" />
<verse sID="Heb.8.3" osisID="Heb.8.3" n="3" />Every high priest is appointed for the purpose of offering gifts and sacrifices to God; it follows, therefore, that this high priest must have some offering to make.
<verse eID="Heb.8.3" />
<verse sID="Heb.8.4" osisID="Heb.8.4" n="4" />If he were, however, still on earth, he would not even be a priest, since there are already priests who offer the gifts as the Law directs.
<verse eID="Heb.8.4" />
<verse sID="Heb.8.5" osisID="Heb.8.5" n="5" />(These priests, it is true, are engaged in a service which is only a copy and shadow of the heavenly realities, as is shown by the directions given to Moses when he was about to construct the tent. ‘Look to it,’ are the words, ‘that you make every part in accordance with the pattern shown you on the mountain.’)
<verse eID="Heb.8.5" />
<verse sID="Heb.8.6" osisID="Heb.8.6" n="6" />But Jesus, as we see, has obtained a ministry as far excelling theirs, as the covenant of which he is the intermediary, based, as it is, on better promises, excels the former covenant.
<verse eID="Heb.8.6" />
<verse sID="Heb.8.7" osisID="Heb.8.7" n="7" />If that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no occasion for a second.
<verse eID="Heb.8.7" />
<verse sID="Heb.8.8" osisID="Heb.8.8" n="8" />But, finding fault with the people, God says –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘“A time is coming,” says the Lord,</l>
<l level="2">“When I will ratify a new covenant with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah – <verse eID="Heb.8.8" /></l>
<l level="1">
<verse sID="Heb.8.9" osisID="Heb.8.9" n="9" />Not such a covenant as I made with their ancestors</l>
<l level="2">on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt.</l>
<l level="1">For they did not abide by their covenant with me,</l>
<l level="2">and therefore I disregarded them,” says the Lord. <verse eID="Heb.8.9" /></l>
<l level="1">
<verse sID="Heb.8.10" osisID="Heb.8.10" n="10" />“This is the covenant that I will make with the people of Israel</l>
<l level="2">after those days,” says the Lord.</l>
<l level="1">“I will impress my laws on their minds,</l>
<l level="2">and will inscribe them on their hearts;</l>
<l level="1">and I will be their God,</l>
<l level="2">and they will be my people. <verse eID="Heb.8.10" /></l>
<l level="1">
<verse sID="Heb.8.11" osisID="Heb.8.11" n="11" />There will be no need for anyone to instruct their fellow citizen,</l>
<l level="2">or for a person to say to their relatives ‘Learn to know the Lord’;</l>
<l level="1">for everyone will know me,</l>
<l level="2">from the lowest to the highest. <verse eID="Heb.8.11" /></l>
<l level="1">
<verse sID="Heb.8.12" osisID="Heb.8.12" n="12" />For I will be merciful to their wrong-doings,</l>
<l level="2">and I will no longer remember their sins.”’ <verse eID="Heb.8.12" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Heb.8.13" osisID="Heb.8.13" n="13" />By speaking of a new covenant, God at once renders the former covenant obsolete; and whatever becomes obsolete and loses its force is virtually annulled.

<chapter sID="Heb.9" osisID="Heb.9" n="9" />
</p>
<!-- s --><title>The New Revelation and the Old</title>
<p>
<verse sID="Heb.9.1" osisID="Heb.9.1" n="1" />It is true that even the first covenant had its regulations for divine worship, and its sanctuary – though only a material one.
<verse eID="Heb.9.1" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.2" osisID="Heb.9.2" n="2" />For a tent was constructed, with an outer part which contained the stand for the lamps, and the table, and the consecrated bread. This is called the sanctuary.
<verse eID="Heb.9.2" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.3" osisID="Heb.9.3" n="3" />The part of the tent behind the second curtain is called the inner sanctuary.
<verse eID="Heb.9.3" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.4" osisID="Heb.9.4" n="4" />In it is the gold incense-altar, and the ark containing the covenant, completely covered with gold. In the ark is a gold casket containing the manna, Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tablets on which the covenant was written;
<verse eID="Heb.9.4" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.5" osisID="Heb.9.5" n="5" />while above it, and overshadowing the cover on which atonement was made, are the cherubim of the presence. Now is not the time to discuss these things in detail.
<verse eID="Heb.9.5" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.6" osisID="Heb.9.6" n="6" />Such, then, was the arrangement of the tent. Into the outer part priests are constantly going, in the discharge of their sacred duties;
<verse eID="Heb.9.6" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.7" osisID="Heb.9.7" n="7" />but into the inner only the high priest goes, and that but once a year, and never without taking the blood of a victim, which he offers on his own behalf, and on behalf of the errors of the people.
<verse eID="Heb.9.7" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.8" osisID="Heb.9.8" n="8" />By this the Holy Spirit is teaching that the way into the sanctuary was hidden, as long as the outer part of the tent still remained.
<verse eID="Heb.9.8" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.9" osisID="Heb.9.9" n="9" />For that was only a type, to continue down to the present time; and, in keeping with it, both gifts and sacrifices are offered, though incapable of satisfying the conscience of the worshiper;
<verse eID="Heb.9.9" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.10" osisID="Heb.9.10" n="10" />the whole system being concerned only with food and drink and various ablutions – external ceremonials imposed until the coming of the new order.
<verse eID="Heb.9.10" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Heb.9.11" osisID="Heb.9.11" n="11" />But, when Christ came, he appeared as high priest of that better system which was established; and he entered through that nobler and more perfect tent, not made by human hands – that is to say, not a part of this present creation.
<verse eID="Heb.9.11" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.12" osisID="Heb.9.12" n="12" />Nor was it with the blood of goats and calves, but with his own blood, that he entered, once and for all, into the sanctuary, and obtained our eternal deliverance.
<verse eID="Heb.9.12" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.13" osisID="Heb.9.13" n="13" />For, if the blood of goats and bulls, and the sprinkling of the ashes of a heifer, purify those who have been defiled (as far as ceremonial purification goes),
<verse eID="Heb.9.13" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.14" osisID="Heb.9.14" n="14" />how much more will the blood of the Christ, who, through his eternal Spirit, offered himself up to God, as a victim without blemish, purify our consciences from a lifeless formality, and fit us for the service of the living God!
<verse eID="Heb.9.14" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.15" osisID="Heb.9.15" n="15" />And that is why he is the intermediary of a new covenant; in order that, as a death has taken place to effect a deliverance from the offenses committed under the first covenant, those who have received the call may obtain the eternal inheritance promised to them.
<verse eID="Heb.9.15" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.16" osisID="Heb.9.16" n="16" />Whenever such a covenant as a will is in question, the death of the testator must of necessity be alleged.
<verse eID="Heb.9.16" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.17" osisID="Heb.9.17" n="17" />For such a covenant takes effect only on death, it does not come into force as long as the testator is alive.
<verse eID="Heb.9.17" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.18" osisID="Heb.9.18" n="18" />This explains why even the first covenant was not ratified without the shedding of blood.
<verse eID="Heb.9.18" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.19" osisID="Heb.9.19" n="19" />For, when every command had been announced to all the people by Moses in accordance with the Law, he took the blood of the calves and of the goats, with water, scarlet wool, and a bunch of hyssop, and sprinkled even the book of the Law, as well as all the people,
<verse eID="Heb.9.19" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.20" osisID="Heb.9.20" n="20" />saying, as he did so – “This is the blood that renders valid the covenant which God has commanded to be made with you.”
<verse eID="Heb.9.20" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.21" osisID="Heb.9.21" n="21" />And in the same way he also sprinkled with the blood the tent and all the things that were used in public worship.
<verse eID="Heb.9.21" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.22" osisID="Heb.9.22" n="22" />Indeed, under the Law, almost everything is purified with blood; and, unless blood is shed, no forgiveness is to be obtained.
<verse eID="Heb.9.22" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Heb.9.23" osisID="Heb.9.23" n="23" />While, then, it was necessary for the copies of the heavenly realities to be purified by such means as these, the heavenly realities themselves required better sacrifices.
<verse eID="Heb.9.23" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.24" osisID="Heb.9.24" n="24" />For it was not into a sanctuary made by human hands, which merely foreshadowed the true one, that Christ entered, but into heaven itself, so that he might now appear in the presence of God on our behalf.
<verse eID="Heb.9.24" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.25" osisID="Heb.9.25" n="25" />Nor yet was it to offer himself may times, as year after year the high priest entered the sanctuary with an offering of blood – but not his own blood;
<verse eID="Heb.9.25" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.26" osisID="Heb.9.26" n="26" />for then Christ would have had to undergo death many times since the creation of the world. But now, once and for all, at the close of the age, he has appeared, in order to abolish sin by the sacrifice of himself.
<verse eID="Heb.9.26" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.27" osisID="Heb.9.27" n="27" />And, as it is ordained for people to die but once (death being followed by judgment),
<verse eID="Heb.9.27" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.28" osisID="Heb.9.28" n="28" />so it is with the Christ. He was offered up once and for all, to bear away the sins of many; and the second time he will appear – but without any burden of sin – to those who are waiting for him, to bring salvation.
<verse eID="Heb.9.28" />
<chapter eID="Heb.9" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Heb.10" osisID="Heb.10" n="10" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.1" osisID="Heb.10.1" n="1" />The Law, though able to foreshadow the better system which was coming, never had its actual substance. Its priests, with those sacrifices which they offer continuously year after year, can never make those who come to worship perfect.
<verse eID="Heb.10.1" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.2" osisID="Heb.10.2" n="2" />Otherwise, would not the offering of these sacrifices have been abandoned, as the worshipers, having been once purified, would have had their consciences clear from sins?
<verse eID="Heb.10.2" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.3" osisID="Heb.10.3" n="3" />But, on the contrary, these sacrifices recall their sins to mind year after year.
<verse eID="Heb.10.3" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.4" osisID="Heb.10.4" n="4" />For the blood of bulls and goats is powerless to remove sins.
<verse eID="Heb.10.4" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.5" osisID="Heb.10.5" n="5" />That is why, when he was coming into the world, the Christ declared –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘Sacrifice and offering you do not desire, but you provide for me a body; <verse eID="Heb.10.5" /></l>
<l level="2">
<verse sID="Heb.10.6" osisID="Heb.10.6" n="6" />You take no pleasure in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin. <verse eID="Heb.10.6" /></l>
<l level="1">
<verse sID="Heb.10.7" osisID="Heb.10.7" n="7" />So I said, “See, I have come” (as is written of me in the pages of the book),</l>
<l level="2">“To do your will, God.”’ <verse eID="Heb.10.7" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Heb.10.8" osisID="Heb.10.8" n="8" />First come the words – ‘You do not desire, nor do you take pleasure in, sacrifices, offerings, burnt offerings, and sacrifices for sin’ (offerings regularly made under the Law),
<verse eID="Heb.10.8" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.9" osisID="Heb.10.9" n="9" />and then there is added – ‘See, I have come to do your will.’ The former sacrifices are set aside to be replaced by the latter.
<verse eID="Heb.10.9" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.10" osisID="Heb.10.10" n="10" />And it is in the fulfillment of the will of God that we have been purified by the sacrifice, once and for all, of the body of Jesus Christ.
<verse eID="Heb.10.10" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.11" osisID="Heb.10.11" n="11" />Every other priest stands day after day at his ministrations, and offers the same sacrifices over and over again – sacrifices that can never take sins away.
<verse eID="Heb.10.11" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.12" osisID="Heb.10.12" n="12" />But, this priest, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins, which should serve for all time, ‘took his seat at the right hand of God,’
<verse eID="Heb.10.12" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.13" osisID="Heb.10.13" n="13" />and has since then been waiting ‘for his enemies to be put as a stool for his feet.’
<verse eID="Heb.10.13" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.14" osisID="Heb.10.14" n="14" />By a single offering he has made perfect for all time those who are being purified.
<verse eID="Heb.10.14" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.15" osisID="Heb.10.15" n="15" />We have also the testimony of the Holy Spirit. For, after saying –

<lg>
<l level="1">
<verse sID="Heb.10.16" osisID="Heb.10.16" n="16" />‘“This is the covenant that I will make with them</l>

<verse sID="Heb.10.29" osisID="Heb.10.29" n="29" />How much worse then, think you, will be the punishment deserved by those who have trampled underfoot the Son of God, who have treated the blood that rendered the covenant valid – the blood by which they were purified – as if it were not holy, and who have outraged the Spirit of love?
<verse eID="Heb.10.29" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.30" osisID="Heb.10.30" n="30" />We know who it was that said –

<verse sID="Heb.10.31" osisID="Heb.10.31" n="31" />It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
<verse eID="Heb.10.31" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Heb.10.32" osisID="Heb.10.32" n="32" />Call to mind those early days in which, after you had received the light, you patiently underwent a long and painful conflict.
<verse eID="Heb.10.32" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.33" osisID="Heb.10.33" n="33" />Sometimes, in consequence of the taunts and injuries heaped on you, you became a public spectacle; and sometimes you suffered through having shown yourselves to be the friends of people who were in the same position in which you had been.
<verse eID="Heb.10.33" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.34" osisID="Heb.10.34" n="34" />For you not only sympathised with those who were in prison, but you even took the confiscation of your possessions joyfully, knowing, as you did, that you had in yourselves a greater possession and a lasting one.
<verse eID="Heb.10.34" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.35" osisID="Heb.10.35" n="35" />Do not, therefore, abandon the confidence that you have gained, for it has a great reward awaiting it.
<verse eID="Heb.10.35" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.36" osisID="Heb.10.36" n="36" />You still have need of patient endurance, in order that, when you have done God’s will, you may obtain the fulfillment of his promise.

<!-- s --><title>Heroes of Faith</title>
<p>
<verse sID="Heb.11.1" osisID="Heb.11.1" n="1" />Faith is the realization of things hoped for – the proof of things not seen.
<verse eID="Heb.11.1" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.2" osisID="Heb.11.2" n="2" />And it was for faith that the people of old were renowned.
<verse eID="Heb.11.2" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.3" osisID="Heb.11.3" n="3" />Faith enables us to perceive that the universe was created at the bidding of God – so that we know that what we see was not made out of visible things.
<verse eID="Heb.11.3" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.4" osisID="Heb.11.4" n="4" />Faith made the sacrifice which Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain’s, and won him renown as a righteous man, God himself establishing his renown by accepting his gifts; and it is by the example of his faith that Abel, though dead, still speaks.
<verse eID="Heb.11.4" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.5" osisID="Heb.11.5" n="5" />Faith led to Enoch’s removal from earth, so that he might not experience death. ‘He could not be found because God had removed him.’ For, before his removal, he was renowned as having pleased God;
<verse eID="Heb.11.5" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.6" osisID="Heb.11.6" n="6" />but without faith it is impossible to please him, for he who comes to God must believe that God exists, and that he rewards those who seek for him.
<verse eID="Heb.11.6" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Heb.11.7" osisID="Heb.11.7" n="7" />It was faith that enabled Noah, after he had received the divine warning about what could not then be foreseen, to build, in reverent obedience, an ark in which to save his family. By his faith he condemned the world, and became possessed of that righteousness which follows on faith.
<verse eID="Heb.11.7" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Heb.11.8" osisID="Heb.11.8" n="8" />It was faith that enabled Abraham to obey the call that he received, and to set out for the place which he was afterward to obtain as his own; and he set out not knowing where he was going.
<verse eID="Heb.11.8" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.9" osisID="Heb.11.9" n="9" />It was faith that made him go to live as an emigrant in the promised land – as in a strange country – living there in tents with Isaac and Jacob, who shared the promise with him.
<verse eID="Heb.11.9" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.10" osisID="Heb.11.10" n="10" />For he was looking for the city with the sure foundations, whose architect and builder is God.
<verse eID="Heb.11.10" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Heb.11.11" osisID="Heb.11.11" n="11" />Again, it was faith that enabled Sarah to conceive (though she was past the age for child-bearing), because she felt sure that he who had given her the promise would not fail her.
<verse eID="Heb.11.11" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.12" osisID="Heb.11.12" n="12" />And so from one man – and that when his powers were dead – there sprang a people as numerous ‘as the stars in the heavens or the countless grains of sand on the shore.’
<verse eID="Heb.11.12" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Heb.11.13" osisID="Heb.11.13" n="13" />All these died sustained by faith. They did not obtain the promised blessings, but they saw them from a distance and welcomed the sight, and they acknowledged themselves to be only aliens and strangers on the earth.
<verse eID="Heb.11.13" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.14" osisID="Heb.11.14" n="14" />Those who speak like this show plainly that they are seeking their homeland.
<verse eID="Heb.11.14" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.15" osisID="Heb.11.15" n="15" />If they had been thinking of the land that they had left, they could have found opportunities to return.
<verse eID="Heb.11.15" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.16" osisID="Heb.11.16" n="16" />But no, they were longing for a better, a heavenly, land! And therefore God was not ashamed to be called their God; indeed he had already prepared them a city.
<verse eID="Heb.11.16" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.17" osisID="Heb.11.17" n="17" />It was faith that enabled Abraham, when put to the test, to offer Isaac as a sacrifice – he who had received the promises offering up his only son,
<verse eID="Heb.11.17" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.18" osisID="Heb.11.18" n="18" />of whom it had been said –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘It is through Isaac that there will be descendants to bear your name.’ <verse eID="Heb.11.18" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Heb.11.19" osisID="Heb.11.19" n="19" />For he argued that God was even able to raise a man from the dead – and indeed, figuratively speaking, Abraham did receive Isaac back from the dead.
<verse eID="Heb.11.19" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.20" osisID="Heb.11.20" n="20" />It was faith that enabled Isaac to bless Jacob and Esau, even with regard to the future.
<verse eID="Heb.11.20" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.21" osisID="Heb.11.21" n="21" />Faith enabled Jacob, when dying, to give his blessing to each of the sons of Joseph, and ‘to bow himself in worship as he leant on the top of his staff.’
<verse eID="Heb.11.21" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.22" osisID="Heb.11.22" n="22" />Faith caused Joseph, when his end was near, to speak of the future migration of the Israelites, and to give instructions with regard to his bones.
<verse eID="Heb.11.22" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.23" osisID="Heb.11.23" n="23" />Faith caused the parents of Moses to hide the child for three months after his birth, for they saw that he was a beautiful child; and they would not respect the king’s order.
<verse eID="Heb.11.23" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.24" osisID="Heb.11.24" n="24" />It was faith that caused Moses, when he was grown up, to refuse the title of ‘son of a daughter of Pharaoh.’
<verse eID="Heb.11.24" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.25" osisID="Heb.11.25" n="25" />He preferred sharing the hardships of God’s people to enjoying the short-lived pleasures of sin.
<verse eID="Heb.11.25" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.26" osisID="Heb.11.26" n="26" />For he counted ‘the reproaches that are heaped on the Christ’ of greater value than the treasures of Egypt, looking forward, as he did, to the reward awaiting him.
<verse eID="Heb.11.26" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.27" osisID="Heb.11.27" n="27" />Faith caused him to leave Egypt, though undaunted by the king’s anger, for he was strengthened in his endurance by the vision of the invisible God.
<verse eID="Heb.11.27" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.28" osisID="Heb.11.28" n="28" />Faith led him to institute the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, so that the Destroyer might not touch the eldest children of the Israelites.
<verse eID="Heb.11.28" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.29" osisID="Heb.11.29" n="29" />Faith enabled the people to cross the Red Sea, as if it had been dry land, while the Egyptians, when they attempted to do so, were drowned.
<verse eID="Heb.11.29" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.30" osisID="Heb.11.30" n="30" />Faith caused the walls of Jericho to fall after being encircled for seven days.
<verse eID="Heb.11.30" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.31" osisID="Heb.11.31" n="31" />Faith saved Rahab, the prostitute, from perishing with the unbelievers, after she had entertained the spies with friendliness.
<verse eID="Heb.11.31" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Heb.11.32" osisID="Heb.11.32" n="32" />Need I add anything more? Time would fail me if I attempted to relate the stories of Gideon, Barak, Samson, and Jephthah, and those of David, Samuel, and the prophets.
<verse eID="Heb.11.32" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.33" osisID="Heb.11.33" n="33" />By their faith they subdued kingdoms, ruled righteously, gained the fulfillment of God’s promises, shut the mouths of lions,
<verse eID="Heb.11.33" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.34" osisID="Heb.11.34" n="34" />quelled the fury of the flames, escaped the edge of the sword, found strength in the hour of weakness, displayed their prowess in war, and routed hostile armies.
<verse eID="Heb.11.34" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.35" osisID="Heb.11.35" n="35" />Women received back their dead raised to life. Some were tortured on the wheel, and refused release in order that they might rise to a better life.
<verse eID="Heb.11.35" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.36" osisID="Heb.11.36" n="36" />Others had to face taunts and blows, and even chains and imprisonment.
<verse eID="Heb.11.36" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.37" osisID="Heb.11.37" n="37" />They were stoned to death, they were tortured, they were swan asunder, they were put to the sword; they wandered about clothed in the skins of sheep or goats, destitute, persecuted, ill-used –
<verse eID="Heb.11.37" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.38" osisID="Heb.11.38" n="38" />people of whom the world was not worthy – roaming in lonely places, and on the mountains, and in caves and holes in the ground.
<verse eID="Heb.11.38" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.39" osisID="Heb.11.39" n="39" />Yet, though they all won renown by their faith, they did not obtain the final fulfillment of God’s promise;
<verse eID="Heb.11.39" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.40" osisID="Heb.11.40" n="40" />since God had in view some better thing for us, so that they would only reach perfection together with us.
<verse eID="Heb.11.40" />
<chapter eID="Heb.11" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Heb.12" osisID="Heb.12" n="12" />
<verse sID="Heb.12.1" osisID="Heb.12.1" n="1" />Seeing, therefore, that there is on every side of us such a throng of witnesses, let us also lay aside everything that hinders us, and the sin that clings about us, and run with patient endurance the race that lies before us,
<verse eID="Heb.12.1" />
<verse sID="Heb.12.2" osisID="Heb.12.2" n="2" />our eyes fixed on Jesus, the leader and perfect example of our faith, who, for the joy that lay before him, endured the cross, heedless of its shame, and now ‘has taken his seat at the right hand’ of the throne of God.
<verse eID="Heb.12.2" />
<verse sID="Heb.12.3" osisID="Heb.12.3" n="3" />Weigh well the example of him who had to endure such opposition from ‘people who were sinning against themselves,’ so that you should not grow weary or faint-hearted.
<verse eID="Heb.12.3" />
<verse sID="Heb.12.4" osisID="Heb.12.4" n="4" />You have not yet, in your struggle with sin, resisted to the death;
<verse eID="Heb.12.4" />
<verse sID="Heb.12.5" osisID="Heb.12.5" n="5" />and you have forgotten the encouraging words which are addressed to you as God’s children –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘My child, think not lightly of the Lord’s discipline,</l>
<l level="2">do not despond when he rebukes you; <verse eID="Heb.12.5" /></l>
<l level="1">
<verse sID="Heb.12.6" osisID="Heb.12.6" n="6" />For it is him whom he loves that he disciplines,</l>
<l level="2">and he chastises every child whom he acknowledges.’ <verse eID="Heb.12.6" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Heb.12.7" osisID="Heb.12.7" n="7" />It is for your discipline that you have to endure all this. God is dealing with you as his children. For where is there a child whom his father does not discipline?
<verse eID="Heb.12.7" />
<verse sID="Heb.12.8" osisID="Heb.12.8" n="8" />If you are left without that discipline, in which all children share, it shows that you are bastards, and not true children.
<verse eID="Heb.12.8" />
<verse sID="Heb.12.9" osisID="Heb.12.9" n="9" />Further, when our earthly fathers disciplined us, we respected them. Should we not, then, much rather yield submission to the Father of souls, and live?
<verse eID="Heb.12.9" />
<verse sID="Heb.12.10" osisID="Heb.12.10" n="10" />Our fathers disciplined us for only a short time and as seemed best to them; but God disciplines us for our true good, to enable us to share his holiness.
<verse eID="Heb.12.10" />
<verse sID="Heb.12.11" osisID="Heb.12.11" n="11" />No discipline is pleasant at the time; on the contrary, it is painful. But afterward its fruit is seen in the peacefulness of a righteous life which is the lot of those who have been trained under it.
<verse eID="Heb.12.11" />
<verse sID="Heb.12.12" osisID="Heb.12.12" n="12" />Therefore ‘lift again the down-dropped hands and straighten the weakened knees;
<verse eID="Heb.12.12" />
<verse sID="Heb.12.13" osisID="Heb.12.13" n="13" />make straight paths for your feet,’ so that the lame limb may not be put out of joint, but rather be cured.

<verse eID="Heb.12.13" />
<!-- s --><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>
<verse sID="Heb.12.14" osisID="Heb.12.14" n="14" />Try earnestly to live at peace with everyone, and to attain to that purity without which no one will see the Lord.
<verse eID="Heb.12.14" />
<verse sID="Heb.12.15" osisID="Heb.12.15" n="15" />Take care that no one fails to use the loving help of God, ‘that no bitterness is allowed to take root and spring up, and cause trouble,’ and so poison the whole community.
<verse eID="Heb.12.15" />
<verse sID="Heb.12.16" osisID="Heb.12.16" n="16" />Take care that no one becomes immoral, or irreligious like Esau, who sold his birthright for a single meal.
<verse eID="Heb.12.16" />
<verse sID="Heb.12.17" osisID="Heb.12.17" n="17" />For you know that even afterward, when he wished to claim his father’s blessing, he was rejected – for he never found an opportunity to repair his error – though he begged for the blessing with tears.
<verse eID="Heb.12.17" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Heb.12.18" osisID="Heb.12.18" n="18" />It is not to tangible ‘flaming fire’ that you have drawn near, nor to ‘gloom, and darkness, and storm,
<verse eID="Heb.12.18" />
<verse sID="Heb.12.19" osisID="Heb.12.19" n="19" />and the blast of a trumpet, and an audible voice.’ Those who heard that voice entreated that they might hear no more,
<verse eID="Heb.12.19" />
<verse sID="Heb.12.20" osisID="Heb.12.20" n="20" />for they could not bear to think of the command – ‘If even an animal touches the mountain, it is to be stoned to death;’
<verse eID="Heb.12.20" />
<verse sID="Heb.12.21" osisID="Heb.12.21" n="21" />and so fearful was the sight that Moses said – ‘I tremble with fear.’
<verse eID="Heb.12.21" />
<verse sID="Heb.12.22" osisID="Heb.12.22" n="22" />No, but it is to Mount Zion that you have drawn near, the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, to countless hosts of angels,
<verse eID="Heb.12.22" />
<verse sID="Heb.12.23" osisID="Heb.12.23" n="23" />to the festal gathering and assemblage of God’s firstborn whose names are enrolled in heaven, to God the judge of all people, to the spirits of the righteous who have attained perfection,
<verse eID="Heb.12.23" />
<verse sID="Heb.12.24" osisID="Heb.12.24" n="24" />to Jesus, the intermediary of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that tells of better things than the blood of Abel.
<verse eID="Heb.12.24" />
<verse sID="Heb.12.25" osisID="Heb.12.25" n="25" />Beware how you refuse to hear him who is speaking. For, if the Israelites did not escape punishment, when they refused to listen to him who taught them on earth the divine will, far worse will it be for us, if we turn away from him who is teaching us from heaven.
<verse eID="Heb.12.25" />
<verse sID="Heb.12.26" osisID="Heb.12.26" n="26" />Then his voice shook the earth, but now his declaration is –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘Still once more I will cause not only the earth to tremble, but also the heavens.’ <verse eID="Heb.12.26" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Heb.12.27" osisID="Heb.12.27" n="27" />And those words ‘still once more’ indicate the passing away of all that is shaken – that is, of all created things – in order that only what is unshaken may remain.
<verse eID="Heb.12.27" />
<verse sID="Heb.12.28" osisID="Heb.12.28" n="28" />Therefore, let us, who have received a kingdom that cannot be shaken, be thankful, and so offer acceptable worship to God, with awe and the deepest respect.
<verse eID="Heb.12.28" />
<verse sID="Heb.12.29" osisID="Heb.12.29" n="29" />For our God is ‘a consuming fire.’

<p>
<chapter sID="Heb.13" osisID="Heb.13" n="13" />
<verse sID="Heb.13.1" osisID="Heb.13.1" n="1" />Let your love for the Lord’s followers continue.
<verse eID="Heb.13.1" />
<verse sID="Heb.13.2" osisID="Heb.13.2" n="2" />Do not neglect to show hospitality; for, through being hospitable, people have all unawares entertained angels.
<verse eID="Heb.13.2" />
<verse sID="Heb.13.3" osisID="Heb.13.3" n="3" />Remember the prisoners, as if you were their fellow prisoners, and the oppressed, not forgetting that you also are still in the body.
<verse eID="Heb.13.3" />
<verse sID="Heb.13.4" osisID="Heb.13.4" n="4" />Let marriage be honored by all and the married life be pure; for God will judge those who are immoral and those who commit adultery.
<verse eID="Heb.13.4" />
<verse sID="Heb.13.5" osisID="Heb.13.5" n="5" />Do not let your conduct be ruled by the love of money. Be content with what you have, for God himself has said –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘I will never forsake you, nor will I ever abandon you.’ <verse eID="Heb.13.5" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Heb.13.6" osisID="Heb.13.6" n="6" />Therefore we may say with confidence –

<l level="1">‘The Lord is my helper, I will not be afraid.</l>
<l level="2">What can mere people do to me?’ <verse eID="Heb.13.6" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Heb.13.7" osisID="Heb.13.7" n="7" />Do not forget your leaders, who told you God’s message. Recall the close of their lives, and imitate their faith.
<verse eID="Heb.13.7" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Heb.13.8" osisID="Heb.13.8" n="8" />Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today – yes, and for ever!
<verse eID="Heb.13.8" />
<verse sID="Heb.13.9" osisID="Heb.13.9" n="9" />Do not let yourselves be carried away by the various novel forms of teaching. It is better to rely for spiritual strength on the divine help, than on regulations regarding food; for those whose lives are guided by such regulations have not found them of service.
<verse eID="Heb.13.9" />
<verse sID="Heb.13.10" osisID="Heb.13.10" n="10" />We are not without an altar; but it is one at which those who still worship in the tent have no right to eat.
<verse eID="Heb.13.10" />
<verse sID="Heb.13.11" osisID="Heb.13.11" n="11" />The bodies of those animals whose blood is brought by the high priest into the sanctuary, as an offering for sin, are burnt outside the camp.
<verse eID="Heb.13.11" />
<verse sID="Heb.13.12" osisID="Heb.13.12" n="12" />And so Jesus, also, to purify the people by his own blood, suffered outside the gate.
<verse eID="Heb.13.12" />
<verse sID="Heb.13.13" osisID="Heb.13.13" n="13" />Therefore let us go out to him ‘outside the camp,’ bearing the same reproaches as he;
<verse eID="Heb.13.13" />
<verse sID="Heb.13.14" osisID="Heb.13.14" n="14" />for here we have no permanent city, but are looking for the city that is to be.
<verse eID="Heb.13.14" />
<verse sID="Heb.13.15" osisID="Heb.13.15" n="15" />Through him let us offer, as our sacrifice, continual praise to God – an offering from lips that glorify his name.
<verse eID="Heb.13.15" />
<verse sID="Heb.13.16" osisID="Heb.13.16" n="16" />Never forget to do kindly acts and to share what you have with others, for such sacrifices are acceptable to God.
<verse eID="Heb.13.16" />
<verse sID="Heb.13.17" osisID="Heb.13.17" n="17" />Obey your leaders, and submit to their control, for they are watching over your souls, since they will have to render an account, so that they may do it with joy, and not in sorrow. That would not be to your advantage.
<verse eID="Heb.13.17" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Heb.13.18" osisID="Heb.13.18" n="18" />Pray for us, for we are sure that our consciences are clear, since our wish is to be occupied with what is good.
<verse eID="Heb.13.18" />
<verse sID="Heb.13.19" osisID="Heb.13.19" n="19" />And I the more earnestly ask for your prayers, so that I may be restored to you the sooner.
<verse eID="Heb.13.19" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Heb.13.20" osisID="Heb.13.20" n="20" />May God, the source of all peace, who brought back from the dead him who, ‘by virtue of the blood that rendered valid the unchangeable covenant, is the great shepherd of God’s Sheep,’ Jesus, our Lord –
<verse eID="Heb.13.20" />
<verse sID="Heb.13.21" osisID="Heb.13.21" n="21" />may God make you perfect in everything that is good, so that you may be able to do his will. May he bring out in us all that is pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be all glory for ever and ever. Amen.
<verse eID="Heb.13.21" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Heb.13.22" osisID="Heb.13.22" n="22" />I beg you, friends, to bear with these words of advice. For I have written only very briefly to you.
<verse eID="Heb.13.22" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Heb.13.23" osisID="Heb.13.23" n="23" />You will be glad to hear that our friend, Timothy, has been set free. If he comes here soon, we will visit you together.
<verse eID="Heb.13.23" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Heb.13.24" osisID="Heb.13.24" n="24" />Give our greeting to all your leaders, and to all Christ’s people. Our friends from Italy send their greetings to you.

<!-- s --><title>Advice on Various Subjects</title>
<p>
<verse sID="Jas.1.2" osisID="Jas.1.2" n="2" />My friends, whatever trials you may face from time to time, always regard them as a reason for rejoicing,
<verse eID="Jas.1.2" />
<verse sID="Jas.1.3" osisID="Jas.1.3" n="3" />knowing, as you do, that the testing of your faith develops endurance.
<verse eID="Jas.1.3" />
<verse sID="Jas.1.4" osisID="Jas.1.4" n="4" />And let endurance do its work perfectly, so that you may be altogether perfect, and in no respect lacking.
<verse eID="Jas.1.4" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Jas.1.5" osisID="Jas.1.5" n="5" />If any one of you lacks wisdom, they should ask wisdom from the God who gives freely to everyone without reproach, and it will be given to them.
<verse eID="Jas.1.5" />
<verse sID="Jas.1.6" osisID="Jas.1.6" n="6" />But they should ask with confidence, never doubting; for the person who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven here and there at the mercy of the wind –
<verse eID="Jas.1.6" />
<verse sID="Jas.1.7" osisID="Jas.1.7" n="7" />Such a person must not expect that they will receive anything from the Lord,
<verse eID="Jas.1.7" />
<verse sID="Jas.1.8" osisID="Jas.1.8" n="8" />vacillating as they are, irresolute at every turn.
<verse eID="Jas.1.8" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Jas.1.9" osisID="Jas.1.9" n="9" />Let a follower in humble circumstances be proud of their exalted position,
<verse eID="Jas.1.9" />
<verse sID="Jas.1.10" osisID="Jas.1.10" n="10" />but a rich follower of their humiliation; for the rich will pass away like a wild flower.
<verse eID="Jas.1.10" />
<verse sID="Jas.1.11" osisID="Jas.1.11" n="11" />As the sun rises, and the hot wind blows, the plant withers, its flower fades, and all its beauty is gone. So is it with the rich. In the midst of their pursuits they will wither away.
<verse eID="Jas.1.11" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Jas.1.12" osisID="Jas.1.12" n="12" />Blessed is the person who remains firm under temptation, for, when they have stood the test, they will receive the crown of life, which the Lord has promised to those who love him.
<verse eID="Jas.1.12" />
<verse sID="Jas.1.13" osisID="Jas.1.13" n="13" />Let no one say, when they are tempted, “It is God who is tempting me!” For God, who cannot be tempted to do wrong, does not himself tempt anyone.
<verse eID="Jas.1.13" />
<verse sID="Jas.1.14" osisID="Jas.1.14" n="14" />A man is in every case tempted by their own passions – allured and enticed by them.
<verse eID="Jas.1.14" />
<verse sID="Jas.1.15" osisID="Jas.1.15" n="15" />Then passion conceives and gives birth to sin, and sin, on reaching maturity, brings forth death.
<verse eID="Jas.1.15" />
<verse sID="Jas.1.16" osisID="Jas.1.16" n="16" />Do not be deceived, my dear friends.
<verse eID="Jas.1.16" />
<verse sID="Jas.1.17" osisID="Jas.1.17" n="17" />Every good thing given us, and every perfect gift, is from above, and comes down to us from the Father of the lights in the heavens, who is himself never subject to change or to eclipse.
<verse eID="Jas.1.17" />
<verse sID="Jas.1.18" osisID="Jas.1.18" n="18" />Because he so willed, he gave us life, through the message of the truth, so that we should be, as it were, a kind of first fruits of his creation.
<verse eID="Jas.1.18" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Jas.1.19" osisID="Jas.1.19" n="19" />Mark this, my dear friends – Let everyone be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to get angry;
<verse eID="Jas.1.19" />
<verse sID="Jas.1.20" osisID="Jas.1.20" n="20" />for human anger does not forward the righteous purpose of God.
<verse eID="Jas.1.20" />
<verse sID="Jas.1.21" osisID="Jas.1.21" n="21" />Therefore, get rid of all filthiness and whatever wickedness still remains, and in a humble spirit receive that message which has been planted in your hearts and is able to save your souls.
<verse eID="Jas.1.21" />
<verse sID="Jas.1.22" osisID="Jas.1.22" n="22" />Put that message into practice, and do not merely listen to it – deceiving yourselves.
<verse eID="Jas.1.22" />
<verse sID="Jas.1.23" osisID="Jas.1.23" n="23" />For, when anyone listens to it and does not practice it, they are like a person looking at their own face in a mirror.
<verse eID="Jas.1.23" />
<verse sID="Jas.1.24" osisID="Jas.1.24" n="24" />They look at themselves, then go on their way,
<verse eID="Jas.1.24" />
<verse sID="Jas.1.25" osisID="Jas.1.25" n="25" />but the person who looks carefully into the perfect Law, the Law of freedom, and continues to do so, not listening to it and then forgetting it, but putting it into practice – that person will be blessed in what they do.
<verse eID="Jas.1.25" />
<verse sID="Jas.1.26" osisID="Jas.1.26" n="26" />When a person appears to be religious, yet does not bridle their tongue, but imposes on their own conscience, that person’s religious observances are valueless.
<verse eID="Jas.1.26" />
<verse sID="Jas.1.27" osisID="Jas.1.27" n="27" />That religious observance which is pure and spotless in the eyes of God our Father is this – to visit orphans and widows in their trouble, and to keep oneself uncontaminated by the world.

<!-- s --><title>Warning on Various Subjects</title>
<p>
<verse sID="Jas.2.1" osisID="Jas.2.1" n="1" />My friends, are you really trying to combine faith in Jesus Christ, our glorified Lord, with discrimination?
<verse eID="Jas.2.1" />
<verse sID="Jas.2.2" osisID="Jas.2.2" n="2" />Suppose a visitor should enter your synagogue, with gold rings and in grand clothes, and suppose a poor man should come in also, in shabby clothes,
<verse eID="Jas.2.2" />
<verse sID="Jas.2.3" osisID="Jas.2.3" n="3" />and you show more respect to the visitor who is wearing grand clothes, and say – “There is a good seat for you here,” but to the poor man – “You must stand; or sit down there by my footstool,”
<verse eID="Jas.2.3" />
<verse sID="Jas.2.4" osisID="Jas.2.4" n="4" />Haven’t you made distinctions among yourselves, and used evil standards of judgement?
<verse eID="Jas.2.4" />
<verse sID="Jas.2.5" osisID="Jas.2.5" n="5" />Listen, my dear friends. Has not God chosen those who are poor in the things of this world to be rich through their faith, and to possess the kingdom which he has promised to those who love him?
<verse eID="Jas.2.5" />
<verse sID="Jas.2.6" osisID="Jas.2.6" n="6" />But you – you insult the poor man! Isn’t it the rich who oppress you? Isn’t it they who drag you into law courts?
<verse eID="Jas.2.6" />
<verse sID="Jas.2.7" osisID="Jas.2.7" n="7" />Isn’t it they who malign that honorable name spoken over you at your baptism?
<verse eID="Jas.2.7" />
<verse sID="Jas.2.8" osisID="Jas.2.8" n="8" />If you keep the royal law which runs – ‘You must love your neighbor as you love yourself,’ you are doing right;
<verse eID="Jas.2.8" />
<verse sID="Jas.2.9" osisID="Jas.2.9" n="9" />but, if you discriminate, you commit a sin, and stand convicted by that same law of being offenders against it.
<verse eID="Jas.2.9" />
<verse sID="Jas.2.10" osisID="Jas.2.10" n="10" />For a person who has laid the Law, as a whole, to heart, but has failed in one particular, is accountable for breaking all its provisions.
<verse eID="Jas.2.10" />
<verse sID="Jas.2.11" osisID="Jas.2.11" n="11" />He who said ‘You must not commit adultery’ also said ‘You must not murder.’ If, then, you commit murder but not adultery, you are still an offender against the Law.
<verse eID="Jas.2.11" />
<verse sID="Jas.2.12" osisID="Jas.2.12" n="12" />Therefore, speak and act as people who are to be judged by the ‘Law of freedom.’
<verse eID="Jas.2.12" />
<verse sID="Jas.2.13" osisID="Jas.2.13" n="13" />For there will be justice without mercy for the person who has not acted mercifully. Mercy triumphs over Justice.
<verse eID="Jas.2.13" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Jas.2.14" osisID="Jas.2.14" n="14" />My friends, what good is it if someone claims that they have faith, but they do not prove it by actions? Can such faith save them?
<verse eID="Jas.2.14" />
<verse sID="Jas.2.15" osisID="Jas.2.15" n="15" />Suppose some brother or sister should be in need of clothes and of daily bread,
<verse eID="Jas.2.15" />
<verse sID="Jas.2.16" osisID="Jas.2.16" n="16" />and one of you says to them – “Go, and peace be with you; keep warm and eat well!” and yet you do not actually give them the necessities of life, what good would it be to them?
<verse eID="Jas.2.16" />
<verse sID="Jas.2.17" osisID="Jas.2.17" n="17" />In just the same way faith, if not followed by actions, is, by itself, a lifeless thing.
<verse eID="Jas.2.17" />
<verse sID="Jas.2.18" osisID="Jas.2.18" n="18" />Someone, indeed, may say – “You are a man of faith, and I am a man of action.”
</p>
<p>
“Then show me your faith,” I reply, “apart from any actions, and I will show you my faith by my actions.”
<verse eID="Jas.2.18" />
<verse sID="Jas.2.19" osisID="Jas.2.19" n="19" />It is a part of your faith, is it not, that there is one God? Good; yet even the demons have that faith, and tremble at the thought.
<verse eID="Jas.2.19" />
<verse sID="Jas.2.20" osisID="Jas.2.20" n="20" />Now do you really want to understand, fool, how it is that faith without actions leads to nothing?
<verse eID="Jas.2.20" />
<verse sID="Jas.2.21" osisID="Jas.2.21" n="21" />Look at our ancestor, Abraham. Was he not justified by his actions after he had offered his son, Isaac, on the altar?
<verse eID="Jas.2.21" />
<verse sID="Jas.2.22" osisID="Jas.2.22" n="22" />You see how, in his case, faith and actions went together; that his faith was perfected as the result of his actions;
<verse eID="Jas.2.22" />
<verse sID="Jas.2.23" osisID="Jas.2.23" n="23" />and that in this way the words of scripture came true – “Abraham believed God, and that was regarded by God as righteousness,” and “He was called the friend of God.”
<verse eID="Jas.2.23" />
<verse sID="Jas.2.24" osisID="Jas.2.24" n="24" />You see, then, that a person is justified by actions, and not by faith alone.
<verse eID="Jas.2.24" />
<verse sID="Jas.2.25" osisID="Jas.2.25" n="25" />Wasn’t it the same with the prostitute, Rahab? Was she not justified by her actions, after she had welcomed the messengers and helped them escape by another road?
<verse eID="Jas.2.25" />
<verse sID="Jas.2.26" osisID="Jas.2.26" n="26" />Just as a body is dead without a spirit, so faith is dead without actions.
<verse eID="Jas.2.26" />
<chapter eID="Jas.2" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Jas.3" osisID="Jas.3" n="3" />
<verse sID="Jas.3.1" osisID="Jas.3.1" n="1" />Not many of you should become teachers, my friends, because you know that we who teach will be judged more strictly than others.
<verse eID="Jas.3.1" />
<verse sID="Jas.3.2" osisID="Jas.3.2" n="2" />We often make mistakes, every one of us. Anyone who does not make mistakes when speaking is indeed a perfect person, able to bridle their whole body as well.
<verse eID="Jas.3.2" />
<verse sID="Jas.3.3" osisID="Jas.3.3" n="3" />When we put bits into horses’ mouths to make them obey us, we change their course the rest of their bodies.
<verse eID="Jas.3.3" />
<verse sID="Jas.3.4" osisID="Jas.3.4" n="4" />Again, think of ships. Large as they are, and even when driven by fierce winds, they are guided by a very small rudder and steered in whatever direction the man at the helm may determine.
<verse eID="Jas.3.4" />
<verse sID="Jas.3.5" osisID="Jas.3.5" n="5" />So is it with the tongue. Small as it is, it is a great boaster. Think how a tiny spark may set the largest forest ablaze!
<verse eID="Jas.3.5" />
<verse sID="Jas.3.6" osisID="Jas.3.6" n="6" />And the tongue is like a spark. It is a world of unrighteousness among the parts of our body. It contaminates the whole body; it sets the whole course of our existence on fire, and is itself set on fire by the flames of Gehenna.
<verse eID="Jas.3.6" />
<verse sID="Jas.3.7" osisID="Jas.3.7" n="7" />For while all kinds of animals, birds and reptiles and sea creatures can be tamed and have been tamed by humans,
<verse eID="Jas.3.7" />
<verse sID="Jas.3.8" osisID="Jas.3.8" n="8" />no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless plague! It is charged with deadly poison!
<verse eID="Jas.3.8" />
<verse sID="Jas.3.9" osisID="Jas.3.9" n="9" />With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse people who are made ‘in God’s likeness.’
<verse eID="Jas.3.9" />
<verse sID="Jas.3.10" osisID="Jas.3.10" n="10" />From the very same mouth come blessings and curses! My friends, it is not right that this should be so.
<verse eID="Jas.3.10" />
<verse sID="Jas.3.11" osisID="Jas.3.11" n="11" />Does a spring give both good and bad water from the same source?
<verse eID="Jas.3.11" />
<verse sID="Jas.3.12" osisID="Jas.3.12" n="12" />Can a fig tree, my friends, bear olives? Or a vine bear figs? No, nor can a brackish well give good water.
<verse eID="Jas.3.12" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Jas.3.13" osisID="Jas.3.13" n="13" />Who among you claims to be wise and intelligent? They should show that their actions are the outcome of a good life lived in the humility of true wisdom.
<verse eID="Jas.3.13" />
<verse sID="Jas.3.14" osisID="Jas.3.14" n="14" />But if you harbor bitter envy and a spirit of rivalry in your hearts, do not boast or deny the truth.
<verse eID="Jas.3.14" />
<verse sID="Jas.3.15" osisID="Jas.3.15" n="15" />That is not the wisdom which comes from above; no, it is earthly, animalistic, demonic.
<verse eID="Jas.3.15" />
<verse sID="Jas.3.16" osisID="Jas.3.16" n="16" />For where envy and rivalry exist, there you will also find disorder and all kinds of bad, worthless actions.
<verse eID="Jas.3.16" />
<verse sID="Jas.3.17" osisID="Jas.3.17" n="17" />But the wisdom from above is, before everything else, pure; then peace-loving, gentle, open to conviction, rich in compassion and good deeds, and free from partiality and insincerity.
<verse eID="Jas.3.17" />
<verse sID="Jas.3.18" osisID="Jas.3.18" n="18" />Justice is the harvest peacemakers will reap from seeds sown in a spirit of peace.
<verse eID="Jas.3.18" />

</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Jas.4" osisID="Jas.4" n="4" />
<verse sID="Jas.4.1" osisID="Jas.4.1" n="1" />What is the cause of the fighting and quarreling that goes on among you? Isn’t it to be found in the desires which are always at war within you?
<verse eID="Jas.4.1" />
<verse sID="Jas.4.2" osisID="Jas.4.2" n="2" />You crave, yet do not have, so you commit murder, so You covet, yet cannot gain your end. You quarrel and fight. You do not have, because you do not ask.
<verse eID="Jas.4.2" />
<verse sID="Jas.4.3" osisID="Jas.4.3" n="3" />You ask, yet do not receive, because you ask for a wrong purpose – to spend what you get on your pleasures.
<verse eID="Jas.4.3" />
<verse sID="Jas.4.4" osisID="Jas.4.4" n="4" />Unfaithful people! Don’t you know that to be friends with the world means to be at enmity with God? Therefore whoever chooses to be friends with the world makes himself an enemy to God.
<verse eID="Jas.4.4" />
<verse sID="Jas.4.5" osisID="Jas.4.5" n="5" />Do you suppose scripture means nothing when it says, ‘Envy results from the longings of the spirit which God has implanted within you?’
<verse eID="Jas.4.5" />
<verse sID="Jas.4.6" osisID="Jas.4.6" n="6" />But he gives us greater grace; and that is why it says, –

<l level="2">but gives grace to the humble.’  <verse eID="Jas.4.6" /></l>

<verse sID="Jas.4.7" osisID="Jas.4.7" n="7" />Therefore submit to God. Stand up to the devil, and he will flee from you.
<verse eID="Jas.4.7" />
<verse sID="Jas.4.8" osisID="Jas.4.8" n="8" />Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Make your hands clean, you sinners; and your hearts pure, you vacillators!
<verse eID="Jas.4.8" />
<verse sID="Jas.4.9" osisID="Jas.4.9" n="9" />Grieve, mourn, and lament! Let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your happiness to gloom!
<verse eID="Jas.4.9" />
<verse sID="Jas.4.10" osisID="Jas.4.10" n="10" />Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you.
<verse eID="Jas.4.10" />
<verse sID="Jas.4.11" osisID="Jas.4.11" n="11" />Do not disparage one another, friends. The person who disparages others, or passes judgment on them, disparages the Law and passes judgment on the Law. But, if you pass judgment on the Law, you are not obeying it, but judging it.
<verse eID="Jas.4.11" />
<verse sID="Jas.4.12" osisID="Jas.4.12" n="12" />There is only one lawgiver and judge – he who has the power both to save and to destroy. So then who are you to pass judgment on your neighbor?
<verse eID="Jas.4.12" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Jas.4.13" osisID="Jas.4.13" n="13" />Listen to me, you who say ‘Today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a town and spend a year there, doing business and making money,’
<verse eID="Jas.4.13" />
<verse sID="Jas.4.14" osisID="Jas.4.14" n="14" />yet you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow! For you are but a puff of smoke that appears for a little while and then vanishes.
<verse eID="Jas.4.14" />
<verse sID="Jas.4.15" osisID="Jas.4.15" n="15" />Instead you should say ‘If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that.’
<verse eID="Jas.4.15" />
<verse sID="Jas.4.16" osisID="Jas.4.16" n="16" />But as it is, you are boasting presumptuously! All such boasting is wicked.
<verse eID="Jas.4.16" />
<verse sID="Jas.4.17" osisID="Jas.4.17" n="17" />The person, then, who knows what is right but fails to do it – that is sin in them.

<verse sID="Jas.5.7" osisID="Jas.5.7" n="7" />Be patient, then, friends, until the coming of the Lord. Even the farmer has to wait for the precious fruit of the earth, watching over it patiently, until it has had the spring and summer rains.
<verse eID="Jas.5.7" />
<verse sID="Jas.5.8" osisID="Jas.5.8" n="8" />And you must be patient also, and not be discouraged; for the Lord’s coming is near.
<verse eID="Jas.5.8" />
<verse sID="Jas.5.9" osisID="Jas.5.9" n="9" />Do not make complaints against one another, friends, or judgment will be passed on you. The judge is already standing at the door!
<verse eID="Jas.5.9" />
<verse sID="Jas.5.10" osisID="Jas.5.10" n="10" />Friends, as an example of the patient endurance of suffering, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.
<verse eID="Jas.5.10" />
<verse sID="Jas.5.11" osisID="Jas.5.11" n="11" />We count those who displayed such endurance blessed! You have heard, too, of Job’s endurance, and have seen what the Lord’s purpose was, for ‘the Lord is full of pity and compassion.’
<verse eID="Jas.5.11" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Jas.5.12" osisID="Jas.5.12" n="12" />Above all things, my friends, never take an oath, either by heaven, or by earth, or by anything else. Let your ‘Yes’ suffice for yes, and ‘No’ for no, so that you may escape condemnation.
<verse eID="Jas.5.12" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Jas.5.13" osisID="Jas.5.13" n="13" />If anyone of you is in trouble, they should pray; if anyone is happy, they should sing hymns.
<verse eID="Jas.5.13" />
<verse sID="Jas.5.14" osisID="Jas.5.14" n="14" />If anyone of you is ill, they should send for the church elders, and let them pray over them, anointing them with oil in the name of the Lord.
<verse eID="Jas.5.14" />
<verse sID="Jas.5.15" osisID="Jas.5.15" n="15" />The prayer offered in faith will save the person who is sick, and the Lord will raise them from their bed; and if they have committed sins, they will be forgiven.
<verse eID="Jas.5.15" />
<verse sID="Jas.5.16" osisID="Jas.5.16" n="16" />Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, so that you may be cured. Great is the power of a good person’s fervent prayer.
<verse eID="Jas.5.16" />
<verse sID="Jas.5.17" osisID="Jas.5.17" n="17" />Elijah was only human like ourselves, but, when he prayed fervently that it might not rain, no rain fell on the land for three and a half years.
<verse eID="Jas.5.17" />
<verse sID="Jas.5.18" osisID="Jas.5.18" n="18" />And, when he prayed again, the clouds brought rain, and the land bore crops.
<verse eID="Jas.5.18" />
<verse sID="Jas.5.19" osisID="Jas.5.19" n="19" />My friends, should one of you be led astray from the truth, and someone bring them back again,
<verse eID="Jas.5.19" />
<verse sID="Jas.5.20" osisID="Jas.5.20" n="20" />be sure that the person who brings a sinner back from their mistaken ways will save that person’s soul from death, and will cover a multitude of sins.

<verse eID="1Pet.1.1" />
<verse sID="1Pet.1.2" osisID="1Pet.1.2" n="2" />and who were chosen in accordance with the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the consecration of the Spirit, to learn obedience, and to be purified by the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ, from Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ. May blessing and peace be yours in ever increasing measure.

<p>
<verse sID="1Pet.1.3" osisID="1Pet.1.3" n="3" />Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has, in his great mercy, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
<verse eID="1Pet.1.3" />
<verse sID="1Pet.1.4" osisID="1Pet.1.4" n="4" />given us the new life of undying hope, that promises an inheritance, imperishable, stainless, unfading, which has been reserved for you in heaven –
<verse eID="1Pet.1.4" />
<verse sID="1Pet.1.5" osisID="1Pet.1.5" n="5" />for you who, through faith, are being guarded by the power of God, awaiting a salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last days.
<verse eID="1Pet.1.5" />
<verse sID="1Pet.1.6" osisID="1Pet.1.6" n="6" />At the thought of this you are full of exultation, though (if it has been necessary) you have suffered for the moment somewhat from various trials;
<verse eID="1Pet.1.6" />
<verse sID="1Pet.1.7" osisID="1Pet.1.7" n="7" />that the genuineness of your faith – a thing far more precious than gold, which is perishable, yet has to be tested by fire – may win praise and glory and honor at the appearing of Jesus Christ.
<verse eID="1Pet.1.7" />
<verse sID="1Pet.1.8" osisID="1Pet.1.8" n="8" />Though you have never seen him, yet you love him; though you do not even now see him, yet you believe in him, and exalt with a triumphant happiness too great for words,
<verse eID="1Pet.1.8" />
<verse sID="1Pet.1.9" osisID="1Pet.1.9" n="9" />as you receive the reward of your faith in the salvation of your souls!
<verse eID="1Pet.1.9" />
<verse sID="1Pet.1.10" osisID="1Pet.1.10" n="10" />It was this salvation that the prophets, who spoke long ago of the blessing intended for you, sought, and strove to comprehend;
<verse eID="1Pet.1.10" />
<verse sID="1Pet.1.11" osisID="1Pet.1.11" n="11" />as they strove to discern what that time could be, to which the Spirit of Christ within them was pointing, when foretelling the sufferings that Christ would have to endure, and the glories that would follow.
<verse eID="1Pet.1.11" />
<verse sID="1Pet.1.12" osisID="1Pet.1.12" n="12" />And it was revealed to them that it was not for themselves, but for you, that they were acting as Ministers of the truths which have now been told to you, by those who, with the help of the Holy Spirit sent from heaven, have brought you the good news – truths into which even angels long to look.

<!-- s --><title>The Christian’s Character</title>
<p>
<verse sID="1Pet.1.13" osisID="1Pet.1.13" n="13" />Therefore concentrate your minds, with the strictest self-control, and fix your hopes on the blessing that is coming for you at the appearing of Jesus Christ.
<verse eID="1Pet.1.13" />
<verse sID="1Pet.1.14" osisID="1Pet.1.14" n="14" />Be like obedient children; do not let your lives be shaped by the passions which once swayed you in the days of your ignorance,
<verse eID="1Pet.1.14" />
<verse sID="1Pet.1.15" osisID="1Pet.1.15" n="15" />but in your whole life show yourselves to be holy, after the pattern of the Holy One from whom you received your call.
<verse eID="1Pet.1.15" />
<verse sID="1Pet.1.16" osisID="1Pet.1.16" n="16" />For scripture says –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘You will be holy, because I am holy.’ <verse eID="1Pet.1.16" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="1Pet.1.17" osisID="1Pet.1.17" n="17" />And since you call on him as ‘Father,’ who judges everyone impartially by what he has done, let respectful awe be the spirit of your lives during the time of your stay on earth.
<verse eID="1Pet.1.17" />
<verse sID="1Pet.1.18" osisID="1Pet.1.18" n="18" />For you know that it was not by perishable things, such as silver and gold, that you were ransomed from the aimless way of living which was handed down to you from your ancestors,
<verse eID="1Pet.1.18" />
<verse sID="1Pet.1.19" osisID="1Pet.1.19" n="19" />but by precious blood, as it were of a lamb, unblemished and spotless, the blood of Christ.
<verse eID="1Pet.1.19" />
<verse sID="1Pet.1.20" osisID="1Pet.1.20" n="20" />Destined for this before the beginning of the world, he has been revealed in these last days for your sakes,
<verse eID="1Pet.1.20" />
<verse sID="1Pet.1.21" osisID="1Pet.1.21" n="21" />who, through him, are faithful to God who raised him from the dead and gave him honor, so that your faith and hope are now in God.
<verse eID="1Pet.1.21" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Pet.1.22" osisID="1Pet.1.22" n="22" />Now that, by your obedience to the truth, you have purified your lives, so that there is growing up among you a genuine affection, love one another earnestly with all your hearts;
<verse eID="1Pet.1.22" />
<verse sID="1Pet.1.23" osisID="1Pet.1.23" n="23" />since your new life has come, not from perishable, but imperishable, seed, through the message of the Everliving God.
<verse eID="1Pet.1.23" />
<verse sID="1Pet.1.24" osisID="1Pet.1.24" n="24" />For –

<l level="1">‘All earthly life is but as grass,</l>
<l level="2">and all its splendor as the flower of grass.</l>
<l level="1">The grass fades,</l>

<l level="3">

<p type="x-noindent">
And that is the teaching of the good news which has been told to you.
<verse eID="1Pet.1.25" />
<chapter eID="1Pet.1" />
<chapter sID="1Pet.2" osisID="1Pet.2" n="2" />
<verse sID="1Pet.2.1" osisID="1Pet.2.1" n="1" />Now that you have done with all malice, all deceitfulness, insincerity, jealous feelings, and all backbiting,
<verse eID="1Pet.2.1" />
<verse sID="1Pet.2.2" osisID="1Pet.2.2" n="2" />like newly born infants, crave pure spiritual milk, so that you may be enabled by it to grow until you attain salvation –
<verse eID="1Pet.2.2" />
<verse sID="1Pet.2.3" osisID="1Pet.2.3" n="3" />since ‘you have found by experience that the Lord is kind.’
<verse eID="1Pet.2.3" />
<verse sID="1Pet.2.4" osisID="1Pet.2.4" n="4" />Come to him, then, as to a living stone, rejected, indeed, by men, but in God’s eyes choice and precious;
<verse eID="1Pet.2.4" />
<verse sID="1Pet.2.5" osisID="1Pet.2.5" n="5" />and, as living stones, form yourselves into a spiritual house, to be a consecrated priesthood, for the offering of spiritual sacrifices that will be acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
<verse eID="1Pet.2.5" />
<verse sID="1Pet.2.6" osisID="1Pet.2.6" n="6" />For there is a passage of scripture that runs –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘See, I am placing in Zion a choice and precious corner-stone;</l>
<l level="2">and those who believe in him will have no cause for shame.’ <verse eID="1Pet.2.6" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="1Pet.2.7" osisID="1Pet.2.7" n="7" />It is to you, then, who believe in him that he is precious, but to those who do not believe he is ‘a stone which, though rejected by the builders, has now itself become the corner-stone,’
<verse eID="1Pet.2.7" />
<verse sID="1Pet.2.8" osisID="1Pet.2.8" n="8" />and ‘a stumbling-block, and a rock which will prove a hindrance.’ They stumble because they do not accept the message. This was the fate destined for them.
<verse eID="1Pet.2.8" />
<verse sID="1Pet.2.9" osisID="1Pet.2.9" n="9" />But you are ‘a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a consecrated nation, God’s own people,’ entrusted with the proclamation of the goodness of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.
<verse eID="1Pet.2.9" />
<verse sID="1Pet.2.10" osisID="1Pet.2.10" n="10" />Once you were ‘not a people,’ but now you are ‘God’s people’; once you ‘had not found mercy,’ but now you ‘have found mercy.’

<!-- s --><title>Practical Appeals in view of the Dangers of the Times.</title>
<p>
<verse sID="1Pet.2.11" osisID="1Pet.2.11" n="11" />Dear friends, I beg you, as pilgrims and strangers on earth, to refrain from indulging the cravings of your earthly nature, for they make war on the soul.
<verse eID="1Pet.2.11" />
<verse sID="1Pet.2.12" osisID="1Pet.2.12" n="12" />Let your daily life among the Gentiles be so upright, that, whenever they malign you as evil-doers, they may learn, as they watch, from the uprightness of your conduct, to praise God ‘at the time when he will visit them.’
<verse eID="1Pet.2.12" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Pet.2.13" osisID="1Pet.2.13" n="13" />Submit to all human institutions for the Lord’s sake, alike to the emperor as the supreme authority,
<verse eID="1Pet.2.13" />
<verse sID="1Pet.2.14" osisID="1Pet.2.14" n="14" />and to governors as sent by him to punish evil-doers and to commend those who do right.
<verse eID="1Pet.2.14" />
<verse sID="1Pet.2.15" osisID="1Pet.2.15" n="15" />For God’s will is this – that you should silence the ignorance of foolish people by doing what is right.
<verse eID="1Pet.2.15" />
<verse sID="1Pet.2.16" osisID="1Pet.2.16" n="16" />Act as free people, yet not using your freedom as those do who make it a cloak for wickedness, but as Servants of God.
<verse eID="1Pet.2.16" />
<verse sID="1Pet.2.17" osisID="1Pet.2.17" n="17" />Show honor to everyone, love the Lord’s followers, ‘revere God, honor the emperor.’
<verse eID="1Pet.2.17" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Pet.2.18" osisID="1Pet.2.18" n="18" />Those of you who are domestic servants should always be submissive and respectful to their masters, not only to those who are good and considerate, but also to those who are arbitrary.
<verse eID="1Pet.2.18" />
<verse sID="1Pet.2.19" osisID="1Pet.2.19" n="19" />For this wins God’s approval when, because conscious of God’s presence, a person who is suffering unjustly bears their troubles patiently.
<verse eID="1Pet.2.19" />
<verse sID="1Pet.2.20" osisID="1Pet.2.20" n="20" />What credit can you claim when, after doing wrong, you take your punishment for it patiently? But, on the other hand, if, after doing right, you take your sufferings patiently, that does win the approval of God.
<verse eID="1Pet.2.20" />
<verse sID="1Pet.2.21" osisID="1Pet.2.21" n="21" />For it was to this that you were called! For Christ, too, suffered – on your behalf – and left you an example, that you should follow in his steps.
<verse eID="1Pet.2.21" />
<verse sID="1Pet.2.22" osisID="1Pet.2.22" n="22" />He ‘never sinned, nor was anything deceitful ever heard from his lips.’
<verse eID="1Pet.2.22" />
<verse sID="1Pet.2.23" osisID="1Pet.2.23" n="23" />He was abused, but he did not answer with abuse; he suffered, but he did not threaten; he entrusted himself to him whose judgments are just.
<verse eID="1Pet.2.23" />
<verse sID="1Pet.2.24" osisID="1Pet.2.24" n="24" />And he ‘himself carried our sins’ in his own body to the cross, so that we might die to our sins, and live for righteousness. ‘His bruising was your healing.’
<verse eID="1Pet.2.24" />
<verse sID="1Pet.2.25" osisID="1Pet.2.25" n="25" />Once you were straying like sheep, but now you have returned to the shepherd and guardian of your souls.
<verse eID="1Pet.2.25" />
<chapter eID="1Pet.2" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="1Pet.3" osisID="1Pet.3" n="3" />
<verse sID="1Pet.3.1" osisID="1Pet.3.1" n="1" />Again, you married women should submit to your husbands, so that if any of them reject the message, they may, apart from the message, be won over, by the conduct of their wives,
<verse eID="1Pet.3.1" />
<verse sID="1Pet.3.2" osisID="1Pet.3.2" n="2" />as they see your pure, reverent conduct.
<verse eID="1Pet.3.2" />
<verse sID="1Pet.3.3" osisID="1Pet.3.3" n="3" />Yours should be, not the external adornment of the arrangement of the hair, the wearing of jewelry, or the putting on of dresses,
<verse eID="1Pet.3.3" />
<verse sID="1Pet.3.4" osisID="1Pet.3.4" n="4" />but the inner life with the imperishable beauty of a quiet and gentle spirit; for this is very precious in God’s sight.
<verse eID="1Pet.3.4" />
<verse sID="1Pet.3.5" osisID="1Pet.3.5" n="5" />It was by this that the holy women of old, who rested their hopes on God, adorned themselves; submitting to their husbands,
<verse eID="1Pet.3.5" />
<verse sID="1Pet.3.6" osisID="1Pet.3.6" n="6" />as Sarah did, who obeyed Abraham, and called him master. And you are her true children, as long as you live good lives, and let nothing terrify you.
<verse eID="1Pet.3.6" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Pet.3.7" osisID="1Pet.3.7" n="7" />Again, those of you who are married men should live considerately with their wives, showing due regard to their sex, as physically weaker than their own, and not forgetting that they share with you in the gift of life. Then you will be able to pray without hindrance.
<verse eID="1Pet.3.7" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Pet.3.8" osisID="1Pet.3.8" n="8" />Lastly, you should all be united, sympathetic, full of love for each other, kind-hearted, humble-minded;
<verse eID="1Pet.3.8" />
<verse sID="1Pet.3.9" osisID="1Pet.3.9" n="9" />never returning evil for evil, or abuse for abuse, but, on the contrary, blessing. It was to this that you were called – to obtain a blessing!
<verse eID="1Pet.3.9" />
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">
<verse sID="1Pet.3.10" osisID="1Pet.3.10" n="10" />‘The person who wants to enjoy life</l>
<l level="2">and see happy days –</l>

<l level="1">
<verse sID="1Pet.3.11" osisID="1Pet.3.11" n="11" />they should turn from evil and do good,</l>
<l level="2">They should seek for peace and follow after it; <verse eID="1Pet.3.11" /></l>
<l level="1">
<verse sID="1Pet.3.12" osisID="1Pet.3.12" n="12" />For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous,</l>
<l level="2">and his ears are attentive to their prayers,</l>
<l level="3">but the face of the Lord is set against those who do wrong.’ <verse eID="1Pet.3.12" /></l>
</lg>
<p>
<verse sID="1Pet.3.13" osisID="1Pet.3.13" n="13" />Who, indeed, is there to harm you, if you prove yourselves to be eager for what is good?
<verse eID="1Pet.3.13" />
<verse sID="1Pet.3.14" osisID="1Pet.3.14" n="14" />Even if you should suffer for righteousness, count yourselves blessed! ‘Do not let people terrify you, or allow yourselves to be dismayed.’
<verse eID="1Pet.3.14" />
<verse sID="1Pet.3.15" osisID="1Pet.3.15" n="15" />Revere the Christ as Lord in your hearts; always ready to give an answer to anyone who asks your reason for the hope that you cherish, but giving it with courtesy and respect,
<verse eID="1Pet.3.15" />
<verse sID="1Pet.3.16" osisID="1Pet.3.16" n="16" />and keeping your consciences clear, so that, whenever you are maligned, those who vilify your good and Christian conduct may be put to shame.
<verse eID="1Pet.3.16" />
<verse sID="1Pet.3.17" osisID="1Pet.3.17" n="17" />It is better that you should suffer, if that should be God’s will, for doing right, than for doing wrong.
<verse eID="1Pet.3.17" />
<verse sID="1Pet.3.18" osisID="1Pet.3.18" n="18" />For Christ himself died to atone for sins once for all – the good on behalf of the bad – that he might bring you to God; his body being put to death, but his spirit entering on new life.
<verse eID="1Pet.3.18" />
<verse sID="1Pet.3.19" osisID="1Pet.3.19" n="19" />And it was then that he went and preached to the imprisoned spirits,
<verse eID="1Pet.3.19" />
<verse sID="1Pet.3.20" osisID="1Pet.3.20" n="20" />who once were disobedient, at the time when God patiently waited, in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared; in which some few lives, eight in all, were saved by means of water.
<verse eID="1Pet.3.20" />
<verse sID="1Pet.3.21" osisID="1Pet.3.21" n="21" />And baptism, which this foreshadowed, now saves you – not the mere cleansing of the body, but the search of a clear conscience after God – through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
<verse eID="1Pet.3.21" />
<verse sID="1Pet.3.22" osisID="1Pet.3.22" n="22" />who has gone into heaven, and is at God’s right hand, where angels and archangels and the powers of heaven now yield submission to him.
<verse eID="1Pet.3.22" />
<chapter eID="1Pet.3" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="1Pet.4" osisID="1Pet.4" n="4" />
<verse sID="1Pet.4.1" osisID="1Pet.4.1" n="1" />Since, then, Christ suffered in body, arm yourselves with the same resolve as he; for he who has suffered in body has ceased to sin,
<verse eID="1Pet.4.1" />
<verse sID="1Pet.4.2" osisID="1Pet.4.2" n="2" />and so will live the rest of his earthly life guided, not by human passions, but by the will of God.
<verse eID="1Pet.4.2" />
<verse sID="1Pet.4.3" osisID="1Pet.4.3" n="3" />Surely in the past you have spent time enough living as the Gentiles delight to live. For your path has lain among scenes of debauchery, licentiousness, drunkenness, revelry, hard-drinking, and profane idolatry.
<verse eID="1Pet.4.3" />
<verse sID="1Pet.4.4" osisID="1Pet.4.4" n="4" />And, because you do not run to the same extremes of profligacy as others, they are astonished, and malign you.
<verse eID="1Pet.4.4" />
<verse sID="1Pet.4.5" osisID="1Pet.4.5" n="5" />But they will have to answer for their conduct to him who is ready to judge both the living and the dead.
<verse eID="1Pet.4.5" />
<verse sID="1Pet.4.6" osisID="1Pet.4.6" n="6" />For that was why the good news was told to the dead also – that, after they have been judged in the body, as people are judged, they might live in the spirit, as God lives.
<verse eID="1Pet.4.6" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Pet.4.7" osisID="1Pet.4.7" n="7" />But the end of all things is near. Therefore exercise self-restraint and be calm, so that you may be able to pray.
<verse eID="1Pet.4.7" />
<verse sID="1Pet.4.8" osisID="1Pet.4.8" n="8" />Above all things, let your love for one another be earnest, for ‘Love throws a veil over countless sins.’
<verse eID="1Pet.4.8" />
<verse sID="1Pet.4.9" osisID="1Pet.4.9" n="9" />Never grudge hospitality to one another.
<verse eID="1Pet.4.9" />
<verse sID="1Pet.4.10" osisID="1Pet.4.10" n="10" />Whatever the gift that each has received, use it in the service of others, as good stewards of the varied bounty of God.
<verse eID="1Pet.4.10" />
<verse sID="1Pet.4.11" osisID="1Pet.4.11" n="11" />When anyone speaks, they should speak as one who is delivering the oracles of God. When anyone is endeavoring to serve others, they should do so in reliance on the strength which God supplies; so that in everything God may be honored through Jesus Christ – to whom be ascribed all honor and might for ever and ever. Amen.
<verse eID="1Pet.4.11" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Pet.4.12" osisID="1Pet.4.12" n="12" />Dear friends, do not be astonished at the trial of fire that you are passing through, to test you, as though something strange were happening to you.
<verse eID="1Pet.4.12" />
<verse sID="1Pet.4.13" osisID="1Pet.4.13" n="13" />No, the more you share the sufferings of the Christ, the more may you rejoice, that, when the time comes for the manifestation of his glory, you may rejoice and exult.
<verse eID="1Pet.4.13" />
<verse sID="1Pet.4.14" osisID="1Pet.4.14" n="14" />If you are insulted for bearing the name of Christ, count yourselves blessed; because the divine glory and the Spirit of God are resting on you.
<verse eID="1Pet.4.14" />
<verse sID="1Pet.4.15" osisID="1Pet.4.15" n="15" />I need hardly say that no one among you must suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or a criminal, or for interfering in matters which do not concern Christians.
<verse eID="1Pet.4.15" />
<verse sID="1Pet.4.16" osisID="1Pet.4.16" n="16" />But, if someone suffers as a Christian, they should not be ashamed of it; they should bring honor to God even though they bear that name.
<verse eID="1Pet.4.16" />
<verse sID="1Pet.4.17" osisID="1Pet.4.17" n="17" />For the time has come for judgment to begin with the house of God; and, if it begins with us, what will be the end of those who reject God’s good news?
<verse eID="1Pet.4.17" />
<verse sID="1Pet.4.18" osisID="1Pet.4.18" n="18" />If ‘a good person is saved only with difficulty, what will become of the godless and the sinful?’
<verse eID="1Pet.4.18" />
<verse sID="1Pet.4.19" osisID="1Pet.4.19" n="19" />Therefore, I say, let those who suffer, because God wills it so, commit their lives into the hands of a faithful Creator, and persevere in doing right.
<verse eID="1Pet.4.19" />
<chapter eID="1Pet.4" />
<chapter sID="1Pet.5" osisID="1Pet.5" n="5" />
</p>
<!-- s --><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>
<verse sID="1Pet.5.1" osisID="1Pet.5.1" n="1" />As for the older ones among you, who are elders in the church, I, their fellow elder, and a witness to the sufferings of the Christ, who will also share in the glory that is to be revealed –
<verse eID="1Pet.5.1" />
<verse sID="1Pet.5.2" osisID="1Pet.5.2" n="2" />I beg you to be true shepherds of the flock of God among you, not because you are compelled, but of your own free will; not from a base love of gain, but with a ready spirit;
<verse eID="1Pet.5.2" />
<verse sID="1Pet.5.3" osisID="1Pet.5.3" n="3" />not as lords of your charges, but as examples to your flock.
<verse eID="1Pet.5.3" />
<verse sID="1Pet.5.4" osisID="1Pet.5.4" n="4" />Then, when the chief shepherd appears, you will win the crown of glory that never fades.
<verse eID="1Pet.5.4" />
<verse sID="1Pet.5.5" osisID="1Pet.5.5" n="5" />Again, you younger ones should show deference to the older. And all of you should put on the badge of humility in mutual service, for ‘God is opposed to the proud, but gives his help to the humble.’
<verse eID="1Pet.5.5" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Pet.5.6" osisID="1Pet.5.6" n="6" />Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, so that he may exalt you in his good time,
<verse eID="1Pet.5.6" />
<verse sID="1Pet.5.7" osisID="1Pet.5.7" n="7" />laying all your anxieties on him, for he makes you his care.
<verse eID="1Pet.5.7" />
<verse sID="1Pet.5.8" osisID="1Pet.5.8" n="8" />Exercise self-control, be watchful. Your adversary, the devil, like a roaring lion, is prowling about, eager to devour you.
<verse eID="1Pet.5.8" />
<verse sID="1Pet.5.9" osisID="1Pet.5.9" n="9" />Stand firm against him, strong in your faith; knowing, as you do, that the sufferings which you are undergoing are being endured to the full by the Lord’s followers throughout the world.
<verse eID="1Pet.5.9" />
<verse sID="1Pet.5.10" osisID="1Pet.5.10" n="10" />God, from whom all help comes, and who called you, by your union with Christ, into his eternal glory, will, when you have suffered for a little while, himself perfect, establish, strengthen you.
<verse eID="1Pet.5.10" />
<verse sID="1Pet.5.11" osisID="1Pet.5.11" n="11" />To him be ascribed dominion for ever. Amen.
<verse eID="1Pet.5.11" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1Pet.5.12" osisID="1Pet.5.12" n="12" />I have been writing to you briefly by the hand of Silas, our true-hearted friend (for so I regard him), to encourage you, and to bear my testimony that in what I have written is to be found the true love of God. On that take your stand.
<verse eID="1Pet.5.12" />
<verse sID="1Pet.5.13" osisID="1Pet.5.13" n="13" />Your sister church in ‘Babylon’ sends you greeting, and so does Mark, who is as a son to me.
<verse eID="1Pet.5.13" />
<verse sID="1Pet.5.14" osisID="1Pet.5.14" n="14" />Greet one another with the kiss of love.
</p>
<p>
May God give his peace to you all in your union with Christ.

<chapter sID="2Pet.1" osisID="2Pet.1" n="1" />
<!-- s --><title>Introduction</title>
<p>
<verse sID="2Pet.1.1" osisID="2Pet.1.1" n="1" />To those to whom, through the justice of our God and Savior Jesus Christ, there has been granted faith equally privileged with our own, from Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ.
<verse eID="2Pet.1.1" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="2Pet.1.2" osisID="2Pet.1.2" n="2" />May blessing and peace be yours in ever increasing measure, as you advance in the knowledge of God and of Jesus, our Lord.
<verse eID="2Pet.1.2" />
<verse sID="2Pet.1.3" osisID="2Pet.1.3" n="3" />For his divine power has given us everything that is needful for a life of piety, as we advance in the knowledge of him who called us by a glorious manifestation of his goodness.
<verse eID="2Pet.1.3" />
<verse sID="2Pet.1.4" osisID="2Pet.1.4" n="4" />For it was through this that he gave us what we prize as the greatest of his promises, that through them you might participate in the divine nature, now that you have fled from the corruption in the world, resulting from human passions.
<verse eID="2Pet.1.4" />
<verse sID="2Pet.1.5" osisID="2Pet.1.5" n="5" />Yes, and for this reason do your best to supplement your faith by goodness, goodness by knowledge,
<verse eID="2Pet.1.5" />
<verse sID="2Pet.1.6" osisID="2Pet.1.6" n="6" />knowledge by self-control, self-control by endurance, endurance by piety,
<verse eID="2Pet.1.6" />
<verse sID="2Pet.1.7" osisID="2Pet.1.7" n="7" />piety by mutual affection, and mutual affection by love.
<verse eID="2Pet.1.7" />
<verse sID="2Pet.1.8" osisID="2Pet.1.8" n="8" />For, when these virtues are yours, in increasing measure, they prevent your being indifferent to, or destitute of, a fuller knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
<verse eID="2Pet.1.8" />
<verse sID="2Pet.1.9" osisID="2Pet.1.9" n="9" />Surely the person who has not these virtues is shortsighted even to blindness, and has chosen to forget that they have been purified from their sins of the past!
<verse eID="2Pet.1.9" />
<verse sID="2Pet.1.10" osisID="2Pet.1.10" n="10" />Therefore, friends, do your best to put God’s call and selection of you beyond all doubt; for, if you do this, you will never fall.
<verse eID="2Pet.1.10" />
<verse sID="2Pet.1.11" osisID="2Pet.1.11" n="11" />For in this way you will be given a triumphant admission into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
</p>
<verse eID="2Pet.1.11" />
<!-- s --><title>The Transfiguration and the ‘Second Coming’ of the Christ</title>
<p>
<verse sID="2Pet.1.12" osisID="2Pet.1.12" n="12" />I will, therefore, always be ready to remind you of all this, even though you know it and are firmly established in the truth that you now hold.
<verse eID="2Pet.1.12" />
<verse sID="2Pet.1.13" osisID="2Pet.1.13" n="13" />But I think it my duty, as long as I live in this ‘tent,’ to rouse you by awakening memories of the past;
<verse eID="2Pet.1.13" />
<verse sID="2Pet.1.14" osisID="2Pet.1.14" n="14" />for I know that the time for this ‘tent’ of mine to be put away is soon coming, as our Lord Jesus Christ himself assured me.
<verse eID="2Pet.1.14" />
<verse sID="2Pet.1.15" osisID="2Pet.1.15" n="15" />So I will do my best to enable you, at any time after my departure, to call these truths to mind.
<verse eID="2Pet.1.15" />
<verse sID="2Pet.1.16" osisID="2Pet.1.16" n="16" />For we were not following cleverly devised stories when we told you of the coming in power of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we had been eye-witnesses of his majesty.
<verse eID="2Pet.1.16" />
<verse sID="2Pet.1.17" osisID="2Pet.1.17" n="17" />For he received honor and glory from God the Father, when from the glory of the Divine Majesty there were borne to his ears words such as these – ‘This is my dearly loved son, who brings me great joy.’
<verse eID="2Pet.1.17" />
<verse sID="2Pet.1.18" osisID="2Pet.1.18" n="18" />These were the words that we heard, borne to our ears from heaven, when we were with him on that sacred mountain.
<verse eID="2Pet.1.18" />
<verse sID="2Pet.1.19" osisID="2Pet.1.19" n="19" />And still stronger is the assurance that we have in the teaching of the prophets; to which you will do well to pay attention (as if it were a lamp shining in a gloomy place), until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.
<verse eID="2Pet.1.19" />
<verse sID="2Pet.1.20" osisID="2Pet.1.20" n="20" />But first be assured of this: There is no prophetic teaching found in scripture that can be interpreted by a person’s unaided reason;
<verse eID="2Pet.1.20" />
<verse sID="2Pet.1.21" osisID="2Pet.1.21" n="21" />for no prophetic teaching ever came in the old days at the mere wish of people, but people, moved by the Holy Spirit, spoke direct from God.

<chapter sID="2Pet.2" osisID="2Pet.2" n="2" />

<!-- s --><title>Warning against separating Christianity from a Holy Life</title>
<p>
<verse sID="2Pet.2.1" osisID="2Pet.2.1" n="1" />But there were false prophets also in the nation, just as there will be false teachers among you, people who will secretly introduce ruinous divisions, disowning even the Lord who bought them, and bringing speedy ruin on themselves.
<verse eID="2Pet.2.1" />
<verse sID="2Pet.2.2" osisID="2Pet.2.2" n="2" />There will be many, too, who will follow their licentious courses, and cause the way of the truth to be maligned.
<verse eID="2Pet.2.2" />
<verse sID="2Pet.2.3" osisID="2Pet.2.3" n="3" />In their covetousness they will try to make you a source of profit by their fabrications; but for a long time past their sentence has not been standing idle, nor their ruin slumbering.
<verse eID="2Pet.2.3" />
<verse sID="2Pet.2.4" osisID="2Pet.2.4" n="4" />Remember, God did not spare angels when they sinned, but sent them down to Tartarus, and consigned them to caverns of darkness, to be kept under guard for judgment.
<verse eID="2Pet.2.4" />
<verse sID="2Pet.2.5" osisID="2Pet.2.5" n="5" />Nor did he spare the world of old; though he preserved Noah, the preacher of righteousness, and seven others, when he brought a flood on the godless world.
<verse eID="2Pet.2.5" />
<verse sID="2Pet.2.6" osisID="2Pet.2.6" n="6" />He condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah and reduced them to ashes, holding them up as a warning to the godless of what was in store for them;
<verse eID="2Pet.2.6" />
<verse sID="2Pet.2.7" osisID="2Pet.2.7" n="7" />but he rescued righteous Lot, whose heart was vexed by the wanton licentiousness of his neighbors;
<verse eID="2Pet.2.7" />
<verse sID="2Pet.2.8" osisID="2Pet.2.8" n="8" />for, seeing and hearing what he did, as he lived his righteous life among them, day after day, Lot’s righteous soul was tortured by their wicked doings.
<verse eID="2Pet.2.8" />
<verse sID="2Pet.2.9" osisID="2Pet.2.9" n="9" />The Lord, therefore, knows how to deliver the pious from temptation, and to keep the wicked, who are even now suffering punishment, in readiness for ‘the day of judgment’ –
<verse eID="2Pet.2.9" />
<verse sID="2Pet.2.10" osisID="2Pet.2.10" n="10" />especially those who, following the promptings of their lower nature, indulge their polluting passions and despise all control. Audacious and self-willed, they feel no awe of the celestial beings, maligning them,
<verse eID="2Pet.2.10" />
<verse sID="2Pet.2.11" osisID="2Pet.2.11" n="11" />even where angels, though excelling them in strength and power, do not bring against them a malignant charge before the Lord.
<verse eID="2Pet.2.11" />
<verse sID="2Pet.2.12" osisID="2Pet.2.12" n="12" />These people, however, like animals without reason, intended by nature to be caught and killed – these people, I say, malign those of whom they know nothing, and will assuredly perish through their own corruption,
<verse eID="2Pet.2.12" />
<verse sID="2Pet.2.13" osisID="2Pet.2.13" n="13" />suffering themselves, as the penalty for the suffering that they have inflicted. They think that pleasure consists in the self-indulgence of the moment. They are a stain and a disgrace, indulging, as they do, in their wanton revelry, even while joining you at your feasts.
<verse eID="2Pet.2.13" />
<verse sID="2Pet.2.14" osisID="2Pet.2.14" n="14" />They have eyes only for adulteresses, eyes never tired of sin; they entice weak souls; their minds are trained to covet; they live under a curse.
<verse eID="2Pet.2.14" />
<verse sID="2Pet.2.15" osisID="2Pet.2.15" n="15" />Leaving the straight road, they have gone astray and followed in the steps of Balaam, the son of Beor, who set his heart on the reward for wrong-doing,
<verse eID="2Pet.2.15" />
<verse sID="2Pet.2.16" osisID="2Pet.2.16" n="16" />but was rebuked for his offense. A dumb animal spoke with a human voice, and checked the prophet’s madness.
<verse eID="2Pet.2.16" />
<verse sID="2Pet.2.17" osisID="2Pet.2.17" n="17" />These people are like springs without water, or mists driven before a gale; and for them the blackest darkness has been reserved.
<verse eID="2Pet.2.17" />
<verse sID="2Pet.2.18" osisID="2Pet.2.18" n="18" />With boastful and foolish talk, they appeal to the passions of people’s lower nature, and, by their profligacy, entice those who are just escaping from the people who live such misguided lives.
<verse eID="2Pet.2.18" />
<verse sID="2Pet.2.19" osisID="2Pet.2.19" n="19" />They promise them freedom, while they themselves are slaves to corrupt habits; for a person is the slave of anything to which they give way.
<verse eID="2Pet.2.19" />
<verse sID="2Pet.2.20" osisID="2Pet.2.20" n="20" />If, after having escaped the polluting influences of the world, through knowing our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, people are again entangled in them, and give way to them, their last state has become worse than their first.
<verse eID="2Pet.2.20" />
<verse sID="2Pet.2.21" osisID="2Pet.2.21" n="21" />It would, indeed, have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after knowing it, to turn away from the holy command delivered to them.
<verse eID="2Pet.2.21" />
<verse sID="2Pet.2.22" osisID="2Pet.2.22" n="22" />In their case is seen the truth of the proverb – ‘A dog returns to what it has vomited’ and ‘A sow after washing to her wallowing-place in the mud.’

<!-- s --><title>A Reassertion of the ‘Second Coming’ of the Christ</title>
<p>
<verse sID="2Pet.3.1" osisID="2Pet.3.1" n="1" />This, dear friends, is my second letter to you. In both of them I have tried, by appealing to your remembrance, to arouse your better feelings.
<verse eID="2Pet.3.1" />
<verse sID="2Pet.3.2" osisID="2Pet.3.2" n="2" />I want you to recall what was foretold by the holy prophets, as well as the command of our Lord and Savior given to you through your apostles.
<verse eID="2Pet.3.2" />
<verse sID="2Pet.3.3" osisID="2Pet.3.3" n="3" />First be assured of this, that, as the age draws to an end, scoffers, led by their own passions,
<verse eID="2Pet.3.3" />
<verse sID="2Pet.3.4" osisID="2Pet.3.4" n="4" />will come and ask scoffingly – ‘Where is his promised coming? Ever since our ancestors passed to their rest, everything remains just as it was when the world was first created!’
<verse eID="2Pet.3.4" />
<verse sID="2Pet.3.5" osisID="2Pet.3.5" n="5" />For they willfully shut their eyes to the fact that long ago the heavens existed; and the earth, also – formed out of water and by the action of water, by the fiat of God;
<verse eID="2Pet.3.5" />
<verse sID="2Pet.3.6" osisID="2Pet.3.6" n="6" />and that by the same means the world which then existed was destroyed in a deluge of water.
<verse eID="2Pet.3.6" />
<verse sID="2Pet.3.7" osisID="2Pet.3.7" n="7" />But the present heavens and earth, by the same fiat, have been reserved for fire, and are being kept for the day of the judgment and destruction of the godless.
<verse eID="2Pet.3.7" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="2Pet.3.8" osisID="2Pet.3.8" n="8" />But you, dear friends, must never shut your eyes to the fact that, to the Lord, one day is the same as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.
<verse eID="2Pet.3.8" />
<verse sID="2Pet.3.9" osisID="2Pet.3.9" n="9" />The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise, as some count slowness; but he is forbearing with you, as it is not his will that any of you should perish, but that all should be brought to repentance.
<verse eID="2Pet.3.9" />
<verse sID="2Pet.3.10" osisID="2Pet.3.10" n="10" />The day of the Lord will come like a thief; and on that day the heavens will pass away with a crash, the elements will be burnt up and dissolved, and the earth and all that is in it will be disclosed.
<verse eID="2Pet.3.10" />
<verse sID="2Pet.3.11" osisID="2Pet.3.11" n="11" />Now, since all these things are in the process of dissolution, think what you yourselves ought to be – what holy and pious lives you ought to lead,
<verse eID="2Pet.3.11" />
<verse sID="2Pet.3.12" osisID="2Pet.3.12" n="12" />while you wait for the coming of the day of God and strive to make it come soon<note placement="foot"><reference type="annotateRef">3:12 </reference>Or: and desire its coming.</note>. At its coming the heavens will be dissolved in fire, and the elements melted by heat,
<verse eID="2Pet.3.12" />
<verse sID="2Pet.3.13" osisID="2Pet.3.13" n="13" />but we look for new heavens and a new earth, where righteousness will have its home, in fulfillment of the promise of God.
<verse eID="2Pet.3.13" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="2Pet.3.14" osisID="2Pet.3.14" n="14" />Therefore, dear friends, in expectation of these things, make every effort to be found by him spotless, blameless, and at peace.
<verse eID="2Pet.3.14" />
<verse sID="2Pet.3.15" osisID="2Pet.3.15" n="15" />Regard our Lord’s forbearance as your one hope of salvation. This is what our dear friend Paul wrote to you, with the wisdom that God gave him.
<verse eID="2Pet.3.15" />
<verse sID="2Pet.3.16" osisID="2Pet.3.16" n="16" />It is the same in all his letters, when he speaks in them about these subjects. There are some things in them difficult to understand, which untaught and weak people distort, just as they do all other writings, to their own ruin.
<verse eID="2Pet.3.16" />
<verse sID="2Pet.3.17" osisID="2Pet.3.17" n="17" />You must, therefore, dear friends, now that you know this beforehand, be on your guard against being led away by the errors of reckless people, and so lapsing from your present steadfastness;
<verse eID="2Pet.3.17" />
<verse sID="2Pet.3.18" osisID="2Pet.3.18" n="18" />and advance in the love and knowledge of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. All glory be to him now and for ever.

<verse eID="1John.1.1" />
<verse sID="1John.1.2" osisID="1John.1.2" n="2" />That life was made visible, and we have seen it. We bear our testimony to it, and tell you of that eternal life which was with the Father and was made visible to us.
<verse eID="1John.1.2" />
<verse sID="1John.1.3" osisID="1John.1.3" n="3" />It is of what we have seen and heard that we now tell you, so that you may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ.

<verse eID="1John.1.5" />
<verse sID="1John.1.6" osisID="1John.1.6" n="6" />If we say that we have fellowship with him and yet continue to walk in the darkness, our words and our lives are a lie.

<verse sID="1John.1.7" osisID="1John.1.7" n="7" />But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, cleanses us from all sin.
<verse eID="1John.1.7" />
<verse sID="1John.1.8" osisID="1John.1.8" n="8" />If we say, “we have no sin,” then we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us.

<verse eID="1John.2.3" />
<verse sID="1John.2.4" osisID="1John.2.4" n="4" />Whoever says “I know him,” but does not keep his commands, is a liar. The truth has no place in them.
<verse eID="1John.2.4" />
<verse sID="1John.2.5" osisID="1John.2.5" n="5" />But the person who keeps God’s word, in them the love of God has indeed reached its perfection. This is how we can be sure we are in him:
<verse eID="1John.2.5" />
<verse sID="1John.2.6" osisID="1John.2.6" n="6" />whoever claims to live in him should live just as Jesus did.

<verse eID="1John.2.7" />
<verse sID="1John.2.8" osisID="1John.2.8" n="8" />Yet, in a way, it is a new command that I am writing to you – which is shown true in Christ’s life and in yours – for the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining.
<verse eID="1John.2.8" />
<verse sID="1John.2.9" osisID="1John.2.9" n="9" />The person who says that they are in the light, and yet hates others, is still in the darkness.
<verse eID="1John.2.9" />
<verse sID="1John.2.10" osisID="1John.2.10" n="10" />The person who loves others is always in the light, and there is nothing within them to cause them to stumble.
<verse eID="1John.2.10" />
<verse sID="1John.2.11" osisID="1John.2.11" n="11" />The person who hates is in the dark. They stumble along in the darkness; they do not know where they are going because the darkness blinds them.

<verse eID="1John.3.1" />
<verse sID="1John.3.2" osisID="1John.3.2" n="2" />Dear friends, we are God’s children now, and what we will be has not yet been revealed. What we do know is that, when it is revealed, we will be like him, because we will see him as he is.
<verse eID="1John.3.2" />
<verse sID="1John.3.3" osisID="1John.3.3" n="3" />And just as he is pure, everyone who has this hope, makes and keeps themselves pure.
<verse eID="1John.3.3" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1John.3.4" osisID="1John.3.4" n="4" />Everyone who lives sinfully is living in violation of God’s law. Sin is lawlessness.
<verse eID="1John.3.4" />
<verse sID="1John.3.5" osisID="1John.3.5" n="5" />You know that Christ appeared to take away our sins and that there is no sin in him.
<verse eID="1John.3.5" />
<verse sID="1John.3.6" osisID="1John.3.6" n="6" />No one who lives in him continues to sin; the sinner has not seen or known him.
<verse eID="1John.3.6" />
<verse sID="1John.3.7" osisID="1John.3.7" n="7" />My children, don’t let anyone mislead you. The person who does what is right is righteous, just as Christ is righteous.
<verse eID="1John.3.7" />
<verse sID="1John.3.8" osisID="1John.3.8" n="8" />The person who lives in sin is a child of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. To undo the devil’s work is the reason the Son of God appeared.
<verse eID="1John.3.8" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1John.3.9" osisID="1John.3.9" n="9" />No child of God sins, because God’s nature dwells in them. They can’t live in sin, because they are God’s children.
<verse eID="1John.3.9" />
<verse sID="1John.3.10" osisID="1John.3.10" n="10" />By this it is made clear who are the children of God and who are the devil’s: anyone who doesn’t do what is right or doesn’t love others is not a child of God.
<verse eID="1John.3.10" />

</p>
<p>

<verse eID="1John.3.16" />
<verse sID="1John.3.17" osisID="1John.3.17" n="17" />If anyone has material possessions, and sees one of our own in need, but closes their heart against that person, how can it be said that the love of God is within them?

<verse eID="1John.4.1" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1John.4.2" osisID="1John.4.2" n="2" />This is the way to recognize the Spirit of God: those who acknowledge Jesus Christ as come in the flesh have God’s Spirit,
<verse eID="1John.4.2" />
<verse sID="1John.4.3" osisID="1John.4.3" n="3" />while a spirit that doesn’t acknowledge Jesus isn’t from God. Instead it is the spirit of the antichrist; you have heard that it was coming, and it is now already in the world!
<verse eID="1John.4.3" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1John.4.4" osisID="1John.4.4" n="4" />You, my children, come from God, and you have successfully resisted such people as these, because he who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world.
<verse eID="1John.4.4" />
<verse sID="1John.4.5" osisID="1John.4.5" n="5" />Those people belong to the world and therefore they speak as the world speaks, and the world listens to them.

<verse eID="1John.4.7" />
<verse sID="1John.4.8" osisID="1John.4.8" n="8" />Those who do not love know nothing of God, for God is love.
<verse eID="1John.4.8" />
<verse sID="1John.4.9" osisID="1John.4.9" n="9" />This is how God showed his love among us: he sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him.
<verse eID="1John.4.9" />
<verse sID="1John.4.10" osisID="1John.4.10" n="10" />This is what love is: it is not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be an atoning sacrifice for our sins.
<verse eID="1John.4.10" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="1John.4.11" osisID="1John.4.11" n="11" />Dear friends, since God loved us in this way, we should love one another.
<verse eID="1John.4.11" />
<verse sID="1John.4.12" osisID="1John.4.12" n="12" />No one has ever seen God, but if we love one another, God lives in us and his love reaches perfection within us.
<verse eID="1John.4.12" />
<verse sID="1John.4.13" osisID="1John.4.13" n="13" />We know that we live in him, and he lives in us, because he has given us a measure of his Spirit.
<verse eID="1John.4.13" />
<verse sID="1John.4.14" osisID="1John.4.14" n="14" />Moreover, we have seen for ourselves and testify that the Father has sent the Son to be the Savior of the world.
<verse eID="1John.4.14" />
<verse sID="1John.4.15" osisID="1John.4.15" n="15" />Whoever acknowledges that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, God lives in them, and they live in God.
<verse eID="1John.4.15" />
<verse sID="1John.4.16" osisID="1John.4.16" n="16" />And so we have come to know and believe the love which God has for us.
</p>
<p>
God is love; and whoever lives in love lives in God, and God lives in them.
<verse eID="1John.4.16" />
<verse sID="1John.4.17" osisID="1John.4.17" n="17" />This is the way love has reached its perfection among us, so that we may have confidence on the day of judgment, because in this world we are like Christ.
<verse eID="1John.4.17" />
<verse sID="1John.4.18" osisID="1John.4.18" n="18" />There is no fear in love; perfect love drives out fear because fear has to do with punishment. So anyone who is afraid has not reached perfection in love.
<verse eID="1John.4.18" />
<verse sID="1John.4.19" osisID="1John.4.19" n="19" />We love, because God first loved us.
<verse eID="1John.4.19" />
<verse sID="1John.4.20" osisID="1John.4.20" n="20" />If someone says ‘I love God,’ and yet hates others, they are a liar. For the person who does not love their brother or sister, whom they have seen, cannot love God, whom they have not seen.
<verse eID="1John.4.20" />
<verse sID="1John.4.21" osisID="1John.4.21" n="21" />Indeed, we have this command from Christ: Those who love God must also love each other.

<verse eID="1John.5.1" />
<verse sID="1John.5.2" osisID="1John.5.2" n="2" />By this we know that we love God’s children – when we love God and carry out his commands.
<verse eID="1John.5.2" />
<verse sID="1John.5.3" osisID="1John.5.3" n="3" />For to love God is to do what he commands and his commands are not a burden,
<verse eID="1John.5.3" />

<verse eID="1John.5.8" />
<verse sID="1John.5.9" osisID="1John.5.9" n="9" />We accept human testimony, surely God’s testimony is even stronger! And God’s testimony is the testimony he has given about his Son.
<verse eID="1John.5.9" />
<verse sID="1John.5.10" osisID="1John.5.10" n="10" />The person who believes in the Son of God has that testimony within them. The person who does not believe God has made God a liar, by not believing the testimony God has given about his Son.
<verse eID="1John.5.10" />
<verse sID="1John.5.11" osisID="1John.5.11" n="11" />And this is that testimony: God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.
<verse eID="1John.5.11" />

<verse eID="1John.5.15" />
<verse sID="1John.5.16" osisID="1John.5.16" n="16" />If anyone sees one of our people committing some sin that is not a sin leading to death, they should ask, and God will give them life.

<verse eID="3John.1.2" />
<verse sID="3John.1.3" osisID="3John.1.3" n="3" />For it was a great joy to me, when some followers of the Lord came and testified to your fidelity to the truth. I know that your own life is guided by the truth.
<verse eID="3John.1.3" />
<verse sID="3John.1.4" osisID="3John.1.4" n="4" />Nothing gives me greater pleasure than to hear from time to time that the lives of my children are guided by the truth.

<verse eID="3John.1.5" />
<verse sID="3John.1.6" osisID="3John.1.6" n="6" />They themselves have testified before the church to your love. You will do well to help them on their way in a manner worthy of the service of God.
<verse eID="3John.1.6" />
<verse sID="3John.1.7" osisID="3John.1.7" n="7" />For it was on behalf of Christ’s name that they set out, not accepting even one thing from the Gentiles.

<verse sID="3John.1.11" osisID="3John.1.11" n="11" />Dear friend, do not follow a bad example, but a good one. The person who does what is good is from God; the person who does what is bad has never seen God.

<p>
<verse sID="Jude.1.3" osisID="Jude.1.3" n="3" />Dear friends, while I was making every effort to write to you about our common salvation, I felt that I must write to you at once to encourage you to fight in defense of the faith that has once for all been entrusted to the keeping of Christ’s people.
<verse eID="Jude.1.3" />
<verse sID="Jude.1.4" osisID="Jude.1.4" n="4" />For there have crept in among you certain godless people, whose sentence has long since been pronounced, and who make the mercy of God an excuse for profligacy, and disown our only lord and master, Jesus Christ.
<verse eID="Jude.1.4" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Jude.1.5" osisID="Jude.1.5" n="5" />Now I want to remind you – but you already know it all – that, though the Lord delivered the people from Egypt, yet he afterward destroyed those who refused to believe in him;
<verse eID="Jude.1.5" />
<verse sID="Jude.1.6" osisID="Jude.1.6" n="6" />and that even those angels, who did not keep to their appointed spheres, but left their proper homes, have been kept by him for the judgment of the great day in everlasting chains and black darkness.
<verse eID="Jude.1.6" />
<verse sID="Jude.1.7" osisID="Jude.1.7" n="7" />Like Sodom and Gomorrah and the towns near them, which gave themselves up to fornication, and fell into unnatural vice, these angels now stand out as a warning, undergoing, as they are, punishment in eternal fire.
<verse eID="Jude.1.7" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Jude.1.8" osisID="Jude.1.8" n="8" />Yet in the same way these people, too, cherishing vain dreams, pollute our human nature, reject control, and malign the celestial beings.
<verse eID="Jude.1.8" />
<verse sID="Jude.1.9" osisID="Jude.1.9" n="9" />Yet even Michael, the archangel, when, in his dispute with the devil, he was arguing about the body of Moses, did not venture to charge him with maligning, but said merely ‘The Lord rebuke you!’
<verse eID="Jude.1.9" />
<verse sID="Jude.1.10" osisID="Jude.1.10" n="10" />But these people malign whatever they do not understand; while they use such things as they know by instinct (like the animals that have no reason) for their own corruption.
<verse eID="Jude.1.10" />
<verse sID="Jude.1.11" osisID="Jude.1.11" n="11" />Alas for them! They walk in the steps of Cain; led astray by Balaam’s love of gain, they plunge into sin, and meet their ruin through rebellion like Korah.
<verse eID="Jude.1.11" />
<verse sID="Jude.1.12" osisID="Jude.1.12" n="12" />These are the people who are blots on your ‘love-feasts,’ when they feast together and provide without scruple for themselves alone. They are clouds without rain, driven before the winds; they are leafless trees without a vestige of fruit, dead through and through, torn up by the roots;
<verse eID="Jude.1.12" />
<verse sID="Jude.1.13" osisID="Jude.1.13" n="13" />they are wild sea waves, foaming with their own shame; they are ‘wandering stars,’ for which the blackest darkness has been reserved for ever.
<verse eID="Jude.1.13" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Jude.1.14" osisID="Jude.1.14" n="14" />To these people, as to others, Enoch, the seventh in descent from Adam, declared – ‘See! The Lord has come with his hosts of holy ones around him,
<verse eID="Jude.1.14" />
<verse sID="Jude.1.15" osisID="Jude.1.15" n="15" />to execute judgment on all people, and to convict all godless people of all their godless acts, which in their ungodliness they have committed, and of all the harsh words which they have spoken against him, godless sinners that they are!’
<verse eID="Jude.1.15" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Jude.1.16" osisID="Jude.1.16" n="16" />These people are always murmuring, and complaining of their lot; they follow where their passions lead them; they have arrogant words on their lips; and they flatter others for the sake of what they can get from them.
<verse eID="Jude.1.16" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Jude.1.17" osisID="Jude.1.17" n="17" />But you should, dear friends, recall what was foretold by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;
<verse eID="Jude.1.17" />
<verse sID="Jude.1.18" osisID="Jude.1.18" n="18" />how they used to say to you – ‘As time draws to an end, there will be scoffers, who will be led by their godless passions.’
<verse eID="Jude.1.18" />
<verse sID="Jude.1.19" osisID="Jude.1.19" n="19" />These are the people – animal and unspiritual – who cause divisions.
<verse eID="Jude.1.19" />
<verse sID="Jude.1.20" osisID="Jude.1.20" n="20" />But you must, dear friends, build up your characters on the foundation of your most holy faith, pray under the guidance of the Holy Spirit,
<verse eID="Jude.1.20" />
<verse sID="Jude.1.21" osisID="Jude.1.21" n="21" />and keep within the love of God, while waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, to bring you to eternal life.
<verse eID="Jude.1.21" />
<verse sID="Jude.1.22" osisID="Jude.1.22" n="22" />To some show pity, because they are in doubt. ‘Drag them out of the fire,’ and save them.
<verse eID="Jude.1.22" />
<verse sID="Jude.1.23" osisID="Jude.1.23" n="23" />To others show pity, but with caution, hating the clothing polluted by their touch.

<!-- s --><title>The Vision of the Seven Seals</title>
<p>
<verse sID="Rev.4.1" osisID="Rev.4.1" n="1" />After this, in my vision, I saw an open door in the heavens, and the first voice that I heard was like the blast of a trumpet speaking to me. It said – ‘Come up here and I will show you what must take place.’
<verse eID="Rev.4.1" />
<verse sID="Rev.4.2" osisID="Rev.4.2" n="2" />Immediately after this I fell into a trance. There stood a throne in heaven, and on the throne was One seated.
<verse eID="Rev.4.2" />
<verse sID="Rev.4.3" osisID="Rev.4.3" n="3" />He who was seated on it was in appearance like a jasper and a sardius; and around the throne there was a rainbow of the color of an emerald.
<verse eID="Rev.4.3" />
<verse sID="Rev.4.4" osisID="Rev.4.4" n="4" />And around the throne were twenty-four other thrones, and on these I saw twenty-four elders sitting clothed in white robes; and on their heads they had crowns of gold.
<verse eID="Rev.4.4" />
<verse sID="Rev.4.5" osisID="Rev.4.5" n="5" />Out from the throne come flashes of lightning, cries, and peals of thunder! There are seven torches burning in front of the throne, which are the seven spirits of God;
<verse eID="Rev.4.5" />
<verse sID="Rev.4.6" osisID="Rev.4.6" n="6" />and in front of the throne is what seemed to be a sea of glass, resembling crystal, while within the space before the throne and around the throne are four creatures full of eyes in front and behind.
<verse eID="Rev.4.6" />
<verse sID="Rev.4.7" osisID="Rev.4.7" n="7" />The first creature is like a lion, the second creature like a calf, the third creature has a face like a man’s, and the fourth creature is like an eagle on the wing.
<verse eID="Rev.4.7" />
<verse sID="Rev.4.8" osisID="Rev.4.8" n="8" />These four creatures have each of them six wings, and all around, and within, they are full of eyes; and day and night they never cease to say –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘Holy, holy, holy is the Lord, our God, the Almighty, who was, and who is, and who will be.’ <verse eID="Rev.4.8" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Rev.4.9" osisID="Rev.4.9" n="9" />And, whenever these creatures give praise and honor and thanks to him who is seated on the throne, to him who lives for ever and ever,
<verse eID="Rev.4.9" />
<verse sID="Rev.4.10" osisID="Rev.4.10" n="10" />the twenty-four elders prostrate themselves before him who is seated on the throne, and worship him who lives for ever and ever, and throw down their crowns before the throne, saying –
<verse eID="Rev.4.10" />
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">
<verse sID="Rev.4.11" osisID="Rev.4.11" n="11" />‘Worthy are you, our Lord and God, to receive all praise, and honor, and power, for you did create all things, and at your bidding they came into being and were created.’ <verse eID="Rev.4.11" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<chapter eID="Rev.4" />
<chapter sID="Rev.5" osisID="Rev.5" n="5" />
<verse sID="Rev.5.1" osisID="Rev.5.1" n="1" />Then I saw at the right hand of him who was seated on the throne a book, with writing inside and out, and sealed with seven seals;
<verse eID="Rev.5.1" />
<verse sID="Rev.5.2" osisID="Rev.5.2" n="2" />and I saw a mighty angel who was proclaiming in a loud voice – ‘Who is worthy to open the book and break its seals?’
<verse eID="Rev.5.2" />
<verse sID="Rev.5.3" osisID="Rev.5.3" n="3" />But no one either in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the book or look within it.
<verse eID="Rev.5.3" />
<verse sID="Rev.5.4" osisID="Rev.5.4" n="4" />At this I wept long, because no one could be found who was worthy to open the book or look within it.
<verse eID="Rev.5.4" />
<verse sID="Rev.5.5" osisID="Rev.5.5" n="5" />But one of the elders said to me – ‘Do not weep. The Lion conquered – the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Scion of David – and can therefore open the book with its seven seals.’
<verse eID="Rev.5.5" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rev.5.6" osisID="Rev.5.6" n="6" />Then, within the space between the throne and the four creatures, and in the midst of the elders, I saw, standing, a Lamb, which seemed to have been sacrificed. It had seven horns and seven eyes. (These eyes are the seven spirits of God, and they are sent into all the world.)
<verse eID="Rev.5.6" />
<verse sID="Rev.5.7" osisID="Rev.5.7" n="7" />The Lamb came forward; and he has taken the book from the right hand of him who was seated on the throne.
<verse eID="Rev.5.7" />
<verse sID="Rev.5.8" osisID="Rev.5.8" n="8" />And, when he had taken the book, the four creatures and the twenty-four elders prostrated themselves before the Lamb, each of them holding a harp and golden bowls full of incense. (These are the prayers of Christ’s people.)
<verse eID="Rev.5.8" />
<verse sID="Rev.5.9" osisID="Rev.5.9" n="9" />And they are singing a new song –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘You are worthy to take the book and break its seals, for you were sacrificed, and with your blood you did buy for God people of every tribe, and language, and people, and nation,
<verse eID="Rev.5.9" />
<verse sID="Rev.5.10" osisID="Rev.5.10" n="10" />and did make them a kingdom of priests in the service of our God, and they are reigning on the earth.’ <verse eID="Rev.5.10" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Rev.5.11" osisID="Rev.5.11" n="11" />Then, in my vision, I heard the voices of many angels around the throne, and of the creatures, and of the elders. In number they were ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands,
<verse eID="Rev.5.11" />
<verse sID="Rev.5.12" osisID="Rev.5.12" n="12" />and they cried in a loud voice –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘Worthy is the Lamb that was sacrificed to receive all power, and wealth, and wisdom, and might, and honor, and praise, and blessing.’ <verse eID="Rev.5.12" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Rev.5.13" osisID="Rev.5.13" n="13" />And I heard every created thing in the air, and on the earth, and under the earth, and on the sea, and all that is in them crying –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘To him who is seated on the throne and to the Lamb be ascribed all blessing, and honor, and praise, and dominion for ever and ever.’ <verse eID="Rev.5.13" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Rev.5.14" osisID="Rev.5.14" n="14" />And the four creatures said ‘Amen,’ and the elders prostrated themselves and worshiped.
<verse eID="Rev.5.14" />
<chapter eID="Rev.5" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Rev.6" osisID="Rev.6" n="6" />
<verse sID="Rev.6.1" osisID="Rev.6.1" n="1" />Then I saw the Lamb break one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four creatures crying with a voice like thunder – ‘Come.’
<verse eID="Rev.6.1" />
<verse sID="Rev.6.2" osisID="Rev.6.2" n="2" />And in my vision I saw a white horse. Its rider held a bow, and he was given a crown, and he went out conquering and to conquer.
<verse eID="Rev.6.2" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rev.6.3" osisID="Rev.6.3" n="3" />When the Lamb broke the second seal, I heard the second creature crying – ‘Come.’
<verse eID="Rev.6.3" />
<verse sID="Rev.6.4" osisID="Rev.6.4" n="4" />Then there went out another horse, a red horse, and to its rider was given the power to deprive the earth of peace, so that people should kill one another; and he was given a great sword.
<verse eID="Rev.6.4" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rev.6.5" osisID="Rev.6.5" n="5" />When the Lamb broke the third seal, I heard the third creature crying – ‘Come.’ And in my vision I saw a black horse. Its rider held scales in his hand.
<verse eID="Rev.6.5" />
<verse sID="Rev.6.6" osisID="Rev.6.6" n="6" />And I heard what seemed to be a voice, coming from among the four creatures, crying – ‘A quart of wheat for a silver coin, and three quarts of barley for a silver coin! But do not harm the oil and the wine.’
<verse eID="Rev.6.6" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rev.6.7" osisID="Rev.6.7" n="7" />When the Lamb broke the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth creature crying – ‘Come.’
<verse eID="Rev.6.7" />
<verse sID="Rev.6.8" osisID="Rev.6.8" n="8" />And in my vision I saw a grey horse. His rider’s name was Death, and Hades rode behind him; and power was given them over the fourth part of the earth, so that they might destroy with sword and famine and death, and by means of the wild Beasts of the earth.
<verse eID="Rev.6.8" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rev.6.9" osisID="Rev.6.9" n="9" />When the Lamb opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been killed for the sake of God’s message and for the testimony which they had borne.
<verse eID="Rev.6.9" />
<verse sID="Rev.6.10" osisID="Rev.6.10" n="10" />They cried in a loud voice – ‘How long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, before you will give judgment and avenge our blood on all who are living on the earth?’
<verse eID="Rev.6.10" />
<verse sID="Rev.6.11" osisID="Rev.6.11" n="11" />Then to each of them was given a white robe, and they were told to rest yet a little longer, until the number of their fellow servants and of their friends in Christ’s service who were about to be put to death, as they had been, should be complete.
<verse eID="Rev.6.11" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rev.6.12" osisID="Rev.6.12" n="12" />And I saw the Lamb break the sixth seal, and then there was a great earthquake. The sun became black, like sackcloth, and the moon, which was at its full, like blood.
<verse eID="Rev.6.12" />
<verse sID="Rev.6.13" osisID="Rev.6.13" n="13" />The stars of the heavens fell to the earth, as when a fig-tree, shaken by a strong wind, drops its unripe fruit.
<verse eID="Rev.6.13" />
<verse sID="Rev.6.14" osisID="Rev.6.14" n="14" />The heavens disappeared like a scroll when it is rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved from its place.
<verse eID="Rev.6.14" />
<verse sID="Rev.6.15" osisID="Rev.6.15" n="15" />Then all the kings of the earth, and the princes, and the generals, and the rich, and the powerful, and every slave and free person, hid themselves in the caves and under the rocks of the mountains;
<verse eID="Rev.6.15" />
<verse sID="Rev.6.16" osisID="Rev.6.16" n="16" />and they are crying to the mountains and the rocks – ‘Fall on us, and hide us from the eyes of him who is seated on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb,
<verse eID="Rev.6.16" />
<verse sID="Rev.6.17" osisID="Rev.6.17" n="17" />for the great day of their wrath is come, and who can stand to meet it?’

</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Rev.7" osisID="Rev.7" n="7" />
<verse sID="Rev.7.1" osisID="Rev.7.1" n="1" />After this, I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, restraining the four winds of the earth, so that no wind should blow over the earth, or over the sea, or against any tree.
<verse eID="Rev.7.1" />
<verse sID="Rev.7.2" osisID="Rev.7.2" n="2" />And, in the east, I saw another angel, ascending, holding the seal of the living God; and he cried in a loud voice to the four angels, to whom there had been given power to harm the earth and the sea –
<verse eID="Rev.7.2" />
<verse sID="Rev.7.3" osisID="Rev.7.3" n="3" />‘Do not harm the earth, or the sea, or the trees, until we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads.’
<verse eID="Rev.7.3" />
<verse sID="Rev.7.4" osisID="Rev.7.4" n="4" />I heard, too, the number of those who had been sealed. It was one hundred and forty-four thousand; and they were from every tribe of the Israelites.

<verse sID="Rev.7.13" osisID="Rev.7.13" n="13" />Then one of the elders turned to me and said ‘Who are these who are robed in white? And where did they come from?’
<verse eID="Rev.7.13" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rev.7.14" osisID="Rev.7.14" n="14" />‘My Lord,’ I answered, ‘it is you who know.’
</p>
<p>
‘These,’ he said, ‘are they who come through the Great Persecution; they washed their robes white in the blood of the Lamb.
<verse eID="Rev.7.14" />
<verse sID="Rev.7.15" osisID="Rev.7.15" n="15" />And therefore it is that they are before the throne of God, and are serving him day and night in his Temple; and he who is seated on the throne will shelter them.
<verse eID="Rev.7.15" />
<verse sID="Rev.7.16" osisID="Rev.7.16" n="16" />Never again will they be hungry, never again will they be thirsty, nor will the sun smite them, nor any scorching heat;
<verse eID="Rev.7.16" />
<verse sID="Rev.7.17" osisID="Rev.7.17" n="17" />for the Lamb that stands in the space before the throne will be their shepherd, and will lead them to life-giving springs of water; and God will wipe away all tears from their eyes.’
<verse eID="Rev.7.17" />

</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Rev.8" osisID="Rev.8" n="8" />
<verse sID="Rev.8.1" osisID="Rev.8.1" n="1" />As soon as the Lamb had broken the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for, it might be, half an hour.

<verse eID="Rev.8.1" />
<!-- s --><title>Vision of Seven Trumpet-Blasts</title>
<p>
<verse sID="Rev.8.2" osisID="Rev.8.2" n="2" />Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.
<verse eID="Rev.8.2" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rev.8.3" osisID="Rev.8.3" n="3" />Next, another angel came and stood at the altar with a golden censer in his hand; and a great quantity of incense was given to him, to mingle with the prayers of all Christ’s people on the golden altar before the throne.
<verse eID="Rev.8.3" />
<verse sID="Rev.8.4" osisID="Rev.8.4" n="4" />The smoke of the incense ascended, with the prayers of Christ’s people, from the hand of the angel before God.
<verse eID="Rev.8.4" />
<verse sID="Rev.8.5" osisID="Rev.8.5" n="5" />Then the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire from the altar, and threw it down on the earth; and there followed peals of thunder, cries, flashes of lightning, and an earthquake.
<verse eID="Rev.8.5" />
<verse sID="Rev.8.6" osisID="Rev.8.6" n="6" />Then the seven angels holding the seven trumpets prepared to blow their blasts.
<verse eID="Rev.8.6" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rev.8.7" osisID="Rev.8.7" n="7" />The first blew; and there came hail and fire mixed with blood, and it fell on the earth. A third part of the earth was burnt up, and a third of the trees, and every blade of grass.
<verse eID="Rev.8.7" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rev.8.8" osisID="Rev.8.8" n="8" />Then the second angel blew; and what appeared to be a great mountain, burning, was hurled into the sea. A third of the sea became blood,
<verse eID="Rev.8.8" />
<verse sID="Rev.8.9" osisID="Rev.8.9" n="9" />and a third part of all created things that are in the sea – that is, of all living things – died, and a third of the ships was destroyed.
<verse eID="Rev.8.9" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rev.8.10" osisID="Rev.8.10" n="10" />Then the third angel blew; and there fell from the heavens a great star, burning like a torch. It fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs.
<verse eID="Rev.8.10" />
<verse sID="Rev.8.11" osisID="Rev.8.11" n="11" />(The star is called ‘Wormwood.’) A third of the water became bitter as wormwood, and so bitter was the water that many died from drinking it.
<verse eID="Rev.8.11" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rev.8.12" osisID="Rev.8.12" n="12" />Then the fourth angel blew; and a third of the sun and a third of the moon and a third of the stars were blasted, so that a third of them was eclipsed, and for a third part of the day there was no light, and at night it was the same.
<verse eID="Rev.8.12" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rev.8.13" osisID="Rev.8.13" n="13" />And, in my vision, I heard an eagle flying in mid-heaven and crying in a loud voice – ‘Woe, woe, woe for all who live on the earth, at the other trumpet-blasts of the three angels who have yet to blow.’
<verse eID="Rev.8.13" />
<chapter eID="Rev.8" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Rev.9" osisID="Rev.9" n="9" />
<verse sID="Rev.9.1" osisID="Rev.9.1" n="1" />Then the fifth angel blew; and I saw a star that had fallen on the earth from the heavens, and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.
<verse eID="Rev.9.1" />
<verse sID="Rev.9.2" osisID="Rev.9.2" n="2" />He opened the bottomless pit, and from the pit rose a smoke like the smoke of a great furnace. The sun and the air grew dark because of the smoke from the pit.
<verse eID="Rev.9.2" />
<verse sID="Rev.9.3" osisID="Rev.9.3" n="3" />Out of the smoke locusts descended on the earth, and they received the same power as that possessed by scorpions.
<verse eID="Rev.9.3" />
<verse sID="Rev.9.4" osisID="Rev.9.4" n="4" />They were told not to harm the grass, or any plant, or any tree, but only those who have not the seal of God on their foreheads.
<verse eID="Rev.9.4" />
<verse sID="Rev.9.5" osisID="Rev.9.5" n="5" />Yet they were not allowed to kill them, but it was ordered that those men should be tortured for five months. Their torture was like the torture caused by a scorpion when it stings a person.
<verse eID="Rev.9.5" />
<verse sID="Rev.9.6" osisID="Rev.9.6" n="6" />In those days people will seek Death and will not find it; They will long to die, but Death flees from them.
<verse eID="Rev.9.6" />
<verse sID="Rev.9.7" osisID="Rev.9.7" n="7" />In appearance the locusts were like horses equipped for battle. On their heads there were what appeared to be crowns that shone like gold, their faces resembled human faces,
<verse eID="Rev.9.7" />
<verse sID="Rev.9.8" osisID="Rev.9.8" n="8" />and they had hair like the hair of a woman, their teeth were like lions’ teeth,
<verse eID="Rev.9.8" />
<verse sID="Rev.9.9" osisID="Rev.9.9" n="9" />and they had what seemed to be iron breastplates, while the noise of their wings was like the noise of chariots drawn by many horses, galloping into battle.
<verse eID="Rev.9.9" />
<verse sID="Rev.9.10" osisID="Rev.9.10" n="10" />They have tails like scorpions, and stings, and in their tails lies their power to harm people for five months.
<verse eID="Rev.9.10" />
<verse sID="Rev.9.11" osisID="Rev.9.11" n="11" />They have as their king the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name, in Hebrew, is ‘Abaddon,’ while, in Greek, his name is ‘Apollyon’ (the Destroyer).
<verse eID="Rev.9.11" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rev.9.12" osisID="Rev.9.12" n="12" />The first Woe has passed; and still there are two Woes to follow!
<verse eID="Rev.9.12" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rev.9.13" osisID="Rev.9.13" n="13" />Then the sixth angel blew; and I heard a voice proceeding from the corners of the golden altar that stood before God.
<verse eID="Rev.9.13" />
<verse sID="Rev.9.14" osisID="Rev.9.14" n="14" />It spoke to the sixth angel – the angel with the trumpet – and said ‘Let loose the four angels that are in chains at the great river Euphrates.’
<verse eID="Rev.9.14" />
<verse sID="Rev.9.15" osisID="Rev.9.15" n="15" />Then the four angels, that were held in readiness for that hour and day and month and year, were let loose, to destroy a third of mankind.
<verse eID="Rev.9.15" />
<verse sID="Rev.9.16" osisID="Rev.9.16" n="16" />The number of the hosts of cavalry was ten thousand times ten thousand, twice told; I heard their number.
<verse eID="Rev.9.16" />
<verse sID="Rev.9.17" osisID="Rev.9.17" n="17" />And this is what the horses and their riders appeared to be like in my vision: They had breastplates of fire, blood-red and sulphurous, and the heads of the horses were like lions’ heads, while out of their mouths issue fire, and smoke, and sulfur.
<verse eID="Rev.9.17" />
<verse sID="Rev.9.18" osisID="Rev.9.18" n="18" />Through these three curses a third of humanity perished – because of the fire, and the smoke, and the sulfur that issued from their mouths;
<verse eID="Rev.9.18" />
<verse sID="Rev.9.19" osisID="Rev.9.19" n="19" />for the power of the horses lies in their mouths and in their tails. For their tails are like snakes, with heads, and it is with them that they do harm.
<verse eID="Rev.9.19" />
<verse sID="Rev.9.20" osisID="Rev.9.20" n="20" />But those who were left of humanity, who had not perished through these curses, did not repent and turn away from what their own hands had made; they would not abandon the worship of demons, and of idols made of gold or silver or brass or stone or wood, which can neither see, nor hear, nor walk;
<verse eID="Rev.9.20" />
<verse sID="Rev.9.21" osisID="Rev.9.21" n="21" />and they did not repent of their murders, or their sorceries, or their licentiousness, or their thefts.
<verse eID="Rev.9.21" />
<chapter eID="Rev.9" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Rev.10" osisID="Rev.10" n="10" />
<verse sID="Rev.10.1" osisID="Rev.10.1" n="1" />Then I saw another mighty angel, descending from heaven. His robe was a cloud; over his head was the rainbow; his face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire;
<verse eID="Rev.10.1" />
<verse sID="Rev.10.2" osisID="Rev.10.2" n="2" />in his hand he held a little book open. He set his right foot on the sea, and his left on the land;
<verse eID="Rev.10.2" />
<verse sID="Rev.10.3" osisID="Rev.10.3" n="3" />and he cried in a loud voice like the roaring of a lion. At his cry the seven peals of thunder spoke, each with its own voice.
<verse eID="Rev.10.3" />
<verse sID="Rev.10.4" osisID="Rev.10.4" n="4" />And, when they spoke, I was about to write; but I heard a voice from heaven say – ‘Keep secret what the seven peals of thunder said, and do not write it down.’
<verse eID="Rev.10.4" />
<verse sID="Rev.10.5" osisID="Rev.10.5" n="5" />Then the angel, whom I had seen standing on the sea and on the land, raised his right hand to the heavens,
<verse eID="Rev.10.5" />
<verse sID="Rev.10.6" osisID="Rev.10.6" n="6" />and swore by him who lives for ever and ever, who created the heavens and all that is in them, and the earth and all that is in it, and the sea and all that is in it, that time should cease to be.
<verse eID="Rev.10.6" />
<verse sID="Rev.10.7" osisID="Rev.10.7" n="7" />Moreover at the time when the seventh angel will speak, when he is ready to blow his blast, then the hidden purposes of God, of which he told the good news to his servants, the prophets, are at once fulfilled.
<verse eID="Rev.10.7" />
<verse sID="Rev.10.8" osisID="Rev.10.8" n="8" />Then came the voice which I had heard from heaven. It spoke to me again, and said – ‘Go and take the book that is open in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the land.’
<verse eID="Rev.10.8" />
<verse sID="Rev.10.9" osisID="Rev.10.9" n="9" />So I went to the angel and asked him to give me the little book. And he said ‘Take it, and eat it. It will be bitter to your stomach, but in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey.’
<verse eID="Rev.10.9" />
<verse sID="Rev.10.10" osisID="Rev.10.10" n="10" />I took the little book out of the angel’s hand and ate it, and, while in my mouth, it was like the sweetest honey; but, when I had eaten it, it was bitter to my stomach.
<verse eID="Rev.10.10" />
<verse sID="Rev.10.11" osisID="Rev.10.11" n="11" />And I was told – ‘You must prophesy again about men of many peoples, and nations, and languages, and about many kings.’
<verse eID="Rev.10.11" />
<chapter eID="Rev.10" />
</p>
<p>
<chapter sID="Rev.11" osisID="Rev.11" n="11" />
<verse sID="Rev.11.1" osisID="Rev.11.1" n="1" />Then I was given a measure like a rod, and a voice said to me – ‘Go and measure the Temple of God and the altar, and count the worshiper there.
<verse eID="Rev.11.1" />
<verse sID="Rev.11.2" osisID="Rev.11.2" n="2" />But omit the court outside the Temple, and do not measure that, for it has been given up to the nations; and the holy City will be under their heel for forty-two months.
<verse eID="Rev.11.2" />
<verse sID="Rev.11.3" osisID="Rev.11.3" n="3" />Then I will give permission to my Two Witnesses, and for those twelve hundred and sixty days they will continue teaching, clothed in sackcloth.’
<verse eID="Rev.11.3" />
<verse sID="Rev.11.4" osisID="Rev.11.4" n="4" />These men are represented by the two olive trees and the two lamps that stand before the Lord of the earth.
<verse eID="Rev.11.4" />
<verse sID="Rev.11.5" osisID="Rev.11.5" n="5" />When anyone wishes to harm them, fire comes from their mouths and consumes their enemies; and whoever wishes to harm them will, in this way, inevitably perish.
<verse eID="Rev.11.5" />
<verse sID="Rev.11.6" osisID="Rev.11.6" n="6" />These men have the power to close the heavens, so that no rain may fall during the time that they are teaching; and they have power to turn the streams into blood, and to smite the land with any curse, whenever they will.
<verse eID="Rev.11.6" />
<verse sID="Rev.11.7" osisID="Rev.11.7" n="7" />As soon as they have completed their testimony, the wild Beast that ascends from the bottomless pit will make war on them and conquer and kill them.
<verse eID="Rev.11.7" />
<verse sID="Rev.11.8" osisID="Rev.11.8" n="8" />Their dead bodies will lie in the streets of the great city, which is mystically spoken of as ‘Sodom’ and ‘Egypt,’ where their Master was crucified.
<verse eID="Rev.11.8" />
<verse sID="Rev.11.9" osisID="Rev.11.9" n="9" />People of all nations, and tribes, and languages, and races look at their dead bodies for three days and a half, and do not allow them to be laid in a grave.
<verse eID="Rev.11.9" />
<verse sID="Rev.11.10" osisID="Rev.11.10" n="10" />Those who live on the earth rejoice over them and are merry, and they will send presents to one another, because these two prophets brought torments on those who live on the earth.
<verse eID="Rev.11.10" />
<verse sID="Rev.11.11" osisID="Rev.11.11" n="11" />After three days and a half the life-giving breath of God entered these men, and they stood up on their feet, and a great terror took possession of those who were watching them.
<verse eID="Rev.11.11" />
<verse sID="Rev.11.12" osisID="Rev.11.12" n="12" />The two men heard a loud voice from heaven which said to them – ‘Come up here,’ and they went up to heaven in the cloud, while their enemies watched them.
<verse eID="Rev.11.12" />
<verse sID="Rev.11.13" osisID="Rev.11.13" n="13" />At that very time a great earthquake occurred. A tenth part of the city fell, and seven thousand people perished in the earthquake. Those who escaped were much terrified, and praised the God of heaven.
<verse eID="Rev.11.13" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rev.11.14" osisID="Rev.11.14" n="14" />The second Woe has passed; and there is a third Woe soon to follow!
<verse eID="Rev.11.14" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rev.11.15" osisID="Rev.11.15" n="15" />Then the seventh angel blew; and loud voices were heard in heaven saying –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he will reign for ever and ever.’ <verse eID="Rev.11.15" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Rev.11.16" osisID="Rev.11.16" n="16" />At this the twenty-four elders, who were seated on their thrones before God, prostrated themselves on their faces and worshiped Him,
<verse eID="Rev.11.16" />
<verse sID="Rev.11.17" osisID="Rev.11.17" n="17" />saying –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘We thank you, Lord, our God, the Almighty, who is and who was, that you have assumed your great power and reigned.
<verse eID="Rev.11.17" />
<verse sID="Rev.11.18" osisID="Rev.11.18" n="18" />The nations were enraged, and your wrath fell on them; the time came for the dead to be judged, and for you to give the reward to your servants the prophets, and to the people of Christ, and to those who honor your name – the high and the low alike – and to destroy those who are destroying the earth.’ <verse eID="Rev.11.18" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Rev.11.19" osisID="Rev.11.19" n="19" />Then the Temple of God in heaven was opened, and the ark containing his covenant was seen in his Temple; and there followed flashes of lightning, cries, peals of thunder, an earthquake, and a great storm of hail.
<verse eID="Rev.11.19" />

</p>
<!-- s --><title>Vision of Seven Figures</title>
<p>
<verse sID="Rev.12.1" osisID="Rev.12.1" n="1" />Then a great portent was seen in the heavens – a woman whose robe was the sun, and who had the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.
<verse eID="Rev.12.1" />
<verse sID="Rev.12.2" osisID="Rev.12.2" n="2" />She was pregnant; and she is crying out in the pain and agony of childbirth.
<verse eID="Rev.12.2" />
<verse sID="Rev.12.3" osisID="Rev.12.3" n="3" />Another portent also was seen in the heavens There was a great red Dragon, with seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads were seven diadems.
<verse eID="Rev.12.3" />
<verse sID="Rev.12.4" osisID="Rev.12.4" n="4" />His tail draws after it a third of the stars in the heavens, and it hurled them down on the earth. The Dragon is standing in front of the woman who is about to give birth to the child, so that he may devour it as soon as it is born.
<verse eID="Rev.12.4" />
<verse sID="Rev.12.5" osisID="Rev.12.5" n="5" />The woman gave birth to a son, a male child, who is destined to rule all the nations with an iron rod; and her child was at once caught up to God on his throne.
<verse eID="Rev.12.5" />
<verse sID="Rev.12.6" osisID="Rev.12.6" n="6" />But the woman fled into the wilderness, where there is a place prepared for her by God, to be tended there for twelve hundred and sixty days.
<verse eID="Rev.12.6" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rev.12.7" osisID="Rev.12.7" n="7" />Then a battle took place in the heavens. Michael and his angels fought with the Dragon. But though the Dragon, with his angels, fought,
<verse eID="Rev.12.7" />
<verse sID="Rev.12.8" osisID="Rev.12.8" n="8" />he did not prevail; and there was no place left for them any longer in the heavens.
<verse eID="Rev.12.8" />
<verse sID="Rev.12.9" osisID="Rev.12.9" n="9" />Then the great Dragon, the primeval snake, known as the ‘devil’ and ‘Satan,’ who deceives all the world, was hurled down to the earth, and his angels were hurled down with him.
<verse eID="Rev.12.9" />
<verse sID="Rev.12.10" osisID="Rev.12.10" n="10" />And I heard a loud voice in heaven which said –
</p>
<lg>
<l level="1">‘Now has begun the day of the salvation, and Power, and Dominion of our God, and the Rule of his Christ; for the Accuser of our people has been hurled down, he who has been accusing them before our God day and night.
<verse eID="Rev.12.10" />
<verse sID="Rev.12.11" osisID="Rev.12.11" n="11" />Their victory was due to the blood of the Lamb, and to the message to which they bore their testimony. In their love of life they shrank not from death.
<verse eID="Rev.12.11" />
<verse sID="Rev.12.12" osisID="Rev.12.12" n="12" />Therefore, be glad, heaven, and all who live in heaven! Alas for the earth and for the sea, for the devil has gone down to you in great fury, knowing that he has but little time.’ <verse eID="Rev.12.12" /></l>
</lg>
<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Rev.12.13" osisID="Rev.12.13" n="13" />When the Dragon saw that he was hurled down to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child.
<verse eID="Rev.12.13" />
<verse sID="Rev.12.14" osisID="Rev.12.14" n="14" />But to the woman were given the two wings of the great eagle, so that she might fly to her place in the wilderness, where she is being tended for one year, and for two years, and for half a year in safety from the snake.
<verse eID="Rev.12.14" />
<verse sID="Rev.12.15" osisID="Rev.12.15" n="15" />Then the snake poured water from its mouth after the woman, like a river, so that it might sweep her away.
<verse eID="Rev.12.15" />
<verse sID="Rev.12.16" osisID="Rev.12.16" n="16" />But Earth came to her help, and opened her mouth and drank up the river which the Dragon had poured out of its mouth.
<verse eID="Rev.12.16" />
<verse sID="Rev.12.17" osisID="Rev.12.17" n="17" />The Dragon was enraged at the woman, and went to fight with the rest of her offspring – those who lay to heart the commands of God and bear their testimony to Jesus;
<verse eID="Rev.12.17" />
<verse sID="Rev.12.18" osisID="Rev.12.18" n="18" />and he took his stand on the sea-shore.

<p>
<chapter sID="Rev.13" osisID="Rev.13" n="13" />
<verse sID="Rev.13.1" osisID="Rev.13.1" n="1" />Then I saw, rising out of the sea, a wild Beast with ten horns and seven heads. On its horns were ten diadems, and on its heads were blasphemous names.
<verse eID="Rev.13.1" />
<verse sID="Rev.13.2" osisID="Rev.13.2" n="2" />The Beast that I saw was like a leopard; but its feet were like a bear’s, and its mouth like the mouth of a lion. The Dragon gave it his power and his throne, and wide dominion.
<verse eID="Rev.13.2" />
<verse sID="Rev.13.3" osisID="Rev.13.3" n="3" />One of its heads seemed to me to have been mortally wounded, but its deadly wound had been healed. The whole earth followed the Beast, wondering;
<verse eID="Rev.13.3" />
<verse sID="Rev.13.4" osisID="Rev.13.4" n="4" />and men worshiped the Dragon, because he had given his dominion to the Beast; while, as they worshiped the Beast, they said – ‘Who can compare with the Beast? And who can fight with it?’
<verse eID="Rev.13.4" />
<verse sID="Rev.13.5" osisID="Rev.13.5" n="5" />The Beast was given a mouth that spoke proudly and blasphemously, and it was empowered to work its will for forty-two months.
<verse eID="Rev.13.5" />
<verse sID="Rev.13.6" osisID="Rev.13.6" n="6" />It opened its mouth only to blaspheme God, to blaspheme his name and his tent – those who live in his tent in heaven.
<verse eID="Rev.13.6" />
<verse sID="Rev.13.7" osisID="Rev.13.7" n="7" />It had been permitted to fight with Christ’s people and to conquer them, and it had received power over men of every tribe, and people, and language, and nation.
<verse eID="Rev.13.7" />
<verse sID="Rev.13.8" osisID="Rev.13.8" n="8" />All who are living on earth will worship it – all whose names have not been written in the Lamb’s book of life, the Lamb that has been sacrificed from the foundation of the world.
<verse eID="Rev.13.8" />
<verse sID="Rev.13.9" osisID="Rev.13.9" n="9" />Let those who have ears hear.
<verse eID="Rev.13.9" />
<verse sID="Rev.13.10" osisID="Rev.13.10" n="10" />Whoever is destined for captivity goes into captivity. Whoever will kill with the sword must inevitably be killed with the sword. (Here there is need for endurance and faith on the part of Christ’s people.)
<verse eID="Rev.13.10" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rev.13.11" osisID="Rev.13.11" n="11" />Then I saw, rising out of the earth, another wild Beast. It had two horns like those of a lamb, and its voice was like a dragon’s.
<verse eID="Rev.13.11" />
<verse sID="Rev.13.12" osisID="Rev.13.12" n="12" />It exercises all the authority of the first Beast under its eyes; and it makes the earth and all who are living on it worship that first Beast, whose mortal wound was healed.
<verse eID="Rev.13.12" />
<verse sID="Rev.13.13" osisID="Rev.13.13" n="13" />It performs great marvels, even causing fire to fall from the heavens to the earth, before people’s eyes;
<verse eID="Rev.13.13" />
<verse sID="Rev.13.14" osisID="Rev.13.14" n="14" />and in consequence of the marvels which it was allowed to perform under the eyes of the Beast, it is able to deceive all who are living on the earth. It tells those who live on the earth to make a statue in honor of the Beast, who, despite the wound from the sword, yet lived.
<verse eID="Rev.13.14" />
<verse sID="Rev.13.15" osisID="Rev.13.15" n="15" />It was permitted to breathe life into the image of the Beast, so that the image of the Beast might speak; and it was also permitted to cause all who refused to worship the image of the Beast to be put to death.
<verse eID="Rev.13.15" />
<verse sID="Rev.13.16" osisID="Rev.13.16" n="16" />High and low, rich and poor, free and enslaved – it causes a brand to be put on the right hand or on the forehead of every one of them,
<verse eID="Rev.13.16" />
<verse sID="Rev.13.17" osisID="Rev.13.17" n="17" />so that no one is able to buy or sell, except those that bear this brand – either the name of the Beast or the number indicated by the letters of his name.
<verse eID="Rev.13.17" />
<verse sID="Rev.13.18" osisID="Rev.13.18" n="18" />(Here there is need for discernment.) The person with ability can compute the number of the Beast; for the number indicates a person’s name. Its number is six hundred and sixty-six.

<p>
<chapter sID="Rev.14" osisID="Rev.14" n="14" />
<verse sID="Rev.14.1" osisID="Rev.14.1" n="1" />Then, in my vision, I saw the Lamb standing on Mount Zion. With him were a hundred and forty-four thousand, with his name and the name of his Father written on their foreheads.
<verse eID="Rev.14.1" />
<verse sID="Rev.14.2" osisID="Rev.14.2" n="2" />And I heard a sound from heaven, like the sound of many waters, and like the sound of a loud peal of thunder; the sound that I heard was like the music of harpers playing on their harps.
<verse eID="Rev.14.2" />
<verse sID="Rev.14.3" osisID="Rev.14.3" n="3" />They are singing what seems to be a new song, before the throne, and before the four creatures and the elders; and no one was able to learn that song except the hundred and forty-four thousand who had been redeemed from earth.
<verse eID="Rev.14.3" />
<verse sID="Rev.14.4" osisID="Rev.14.4" n="4" />These are the men who never defiled themselves in their intercourse with women; they are as pure as virgins. These are the men who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They were redeemed as the first-fruits of mankind for God and for the Lamb.
<verse eID="Rev.14.4" />
<verse sID="Rev.14.5" osisID="Rev.14.5" n="5" />No lie was ever heard on their lips. They are beyond reach of blame.
<verse eID="Rev.14.5" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rev.14.6" osisID="Rev.14.6" n="6" />Then I saw another angel, flying in mid-heaven. He had the good news, decreed from eternity, to announce to those who live on the earth – to men of every nation, and tribe, and language, and people;
<verse eID="Rev.14.6" />
<verse sID="Rev.14.7" osisID="Rev.14.7" n="7" />and he cried in a loud voice – ‘Reverence God, and give him praise (for the hour of his judgment has come) and worship him who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all springs of water.’
<verse eID="Rev.14.7" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rev.14.8" osisID="Rev.14.8" n="8" />Then a second angel followed, crying – ‘She has fallen! She has fallen – Babylon the Great, who has made all the nations drink the maddening wine of her licentiousness!’
<verse eID="Rev.14.8" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rev.14.9" osisID="Rev.14.9" n="9" />Then a third angel followed them, crying in a loud voice – ‘Whoever worships the Beast and its image, and receives its brand on his forehead or on his hand,
<verse eID="Rev.14.9" />
<verse sID="Rev.14.10" osisID="Rev.14.10" n="10" />that person will drink the maddening wine of God that has been poured unmixed into the cup of his wrath, and they will be tortured with fire and sulfur before the eyes of the holy angels and before the eyes of the Lamb.
<verse eID="Rev.14.10" />
<verse sID="Rev.14.11" osisID="Rev.14.11" n="11" />The smoke from their torture rises for ever and ever, and they have no rest day nor night – those who worship the Beast and its image, and all who are branded with its name.’
<verse eID="Rev.14.11" />
<verse sID="Rev.14.12" osisID="Rev.14.12" n="12" />(Here there is need for endurance on the part of Christ’s people – those who lay to heart the commands of God and the faith of Jesus.)
<verse eID="Rev.14.12" />
<verse sID="Rev.14.13" osisID="Rev.14.13" n="13" />Then I heard a voice from heaven saying ‘Write: “Blessed are the dead who from this hour die in union with the Lord.”’
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” answers the Spirit, “that they may rest from their toil. Their good deeds go with them.”
<verse eID="Rev.14.13" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rev.14.14" osisID="Rev.14.14" n="14" />Then, in my vision, I saw a white cloud, and on the cloud there was sitting one like a man. On his head he had a crown of gold, and in his hand a sharp sickle.
<verse eID="Rev.14.14" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rev.14.15" osisID="Rev.14.15" n="15" />Then another angel came out from the Temple, crying in a loud voice to him who was sitting on the cloud – ‘Take your sickle and reap, for the time to reap has come; the Harvest of Earth is ready.’
<verse eID="Rev.14.15" />
<verse sID="Rev.14.16" osisID="Rev.14.16" n="16" />He who was sitting on the cloud brought his sickle down on the earth, and the Harvest of Earth was reaped.
<verse eID="Rev.14.16" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rev.14.17" osisID="Rev.14.17" n="17" />Then another angel came out of the Temple in heaven; he, also, had a sharp sickle.
<verse eID="Rev.14.17" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rev.14.18" osisID="Rev.14.18" n="18" />Then another angel came out of the altar; he had power over fire, and he called in a loud voice to the angel that had the sharp sickle – ‘Take your sharp sickle, and gather the bunches from the vine of Earth, for its grapes are ripe.’
<verse eID="Rev.14.18" />
<verse sID="Rev.14.19" osisID="Rev.14.19" n="19" />The angel brought his sickle down on the earth and gathered the fruit of the vine of Earth, and threw it into the great winepress of the wrath of God.
<verse eID="Rev.14.19" />
<verse sID="Rev.14.20" osisID="Rev.14.20" n="20" />The grapes were trodden in the press outside the city; and blood came out of the press, rising as high as the bridles of the horses for a distance of two hundred miles.

<!-- s --><title>Vision of Seven Curses</title>
<p>
<verse sID="Rev.15.1" osisID="Rev.15.1" n="1" />Then I saw another portent in the heavens – a great and marvelous portent – seven angels with the seven last curses; because with them the wrath of God is ended.
<verse eID="Rev.15.1" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rev.15.2" osisID="Rev.15.2" n="2" />Then I saw what appeared to be a sea of glass mixed with fire; and, standing by this sea of glass, holding the harps of God, I saw those who had come victorious out of the conflict with the Beast and its image and the number that formed its name.
<verse eID="Rev.15.2" />
<verse sID="Rev.15.3" osisID="Rev.15.3" n="3" />They are singing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb –

<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Rev.15.5" osisID="Rev.15.5" n="5" />After this I saw that the inmost shrine of the tent of testimony in heaven was opened,
<verse eID="Rev.15.5" />
<verse sID="Rev.15.6" osisID="Rev.15.6" n="6" />and out of it came the seven angels with the seven curses. They were adorned with precious stones, pure and bright, and had golden girdles around their breasts.
<verse eID="Rev.15.6" />
<verse sID="Rev.15.7" osisID="Rev.15.7" n="7" />One of the four creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls, filled with the wrath of God who lives for ever and ever.
<verse eID="Rev.15.7" />
<verse sID="Rev.15.8" osisID="Rev.15.8" n="8" />The Temple was filled with smoke from the glory and majesty of God; and no one could enter the Temple, until the seven curses inflicted by the seven angels were at an end.

<chapter sID="Rev.16" osisID="Rev.16" n="16" />
<verse sID="Rev.16.1" osisID="Rev.16.1" n="1" />Then I heard a loud voice, which came from the Temple, saying to the seven angels – ‘Go and empty the seven bowls of the wrath of God on the earth.’
<verse eID="Rev.16.1" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rev.16.2" osisID="Rev.16.2" n="2" />The first angel went and emptied his bowl on the earth; and it turned to loathsome and painful sores on all who bore the brand of the Beast and who worshiped its image.
<verse eID="Rev.16.2" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rev.16.3" osisID="Rev.16.3" n="3" />Then the second angel emptied his bowl on the sea; and it turned to blood like the blood of a corpse, and every living thing died – everything in the sea.
<verse eID="Rev.16.3" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rev.16.4" osisID="Rev.16.4" n="4" />Then the third angel emptied his bowl on the rivers and springs of water; and it turned to blood.
<verse eID="Rev.16.4" />
<verse sID="Rev.16.5" osisID="Rev.16.5" n="5" />And I heard the angel of the Waters saying – ‘Righteous are you, you who is and who is, the Holy One, in inflicting this judgment;
<verse eID="Rev.16.5" />
<verse sID="Rev.16.6" osisID="Rev.16.6" n="6" />for men shed the blood of Christ’s people and of the prophets, and you have given them blood to drink. It is what they deserve.’
<verse eID="Rev.16.6" />

<verse eID="Rev.16.7" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rev.16.8" osisID="Rev.16.8" n="8" />Then the fourth angel emptied his bowl on the sun; and he was permitted to scorch men with fire;
<verse eID="Rev.16.8" />
<verse sID="Rev.16.9" osisID="Rev.16.9" n="9" />and men were scorched by the intense heat. They blasphemed the name of God who controlled these curses, yet they did not repent and give him praise.
<verse eID="Rev.16.9" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rev.16.10" osisID="Rev.16.10" n="10" />Then the fifth angel emptied his bowl on the throne of the Beast; and darkness fell on its kingdom. Men gnawed their tongues for pain,
<verse eID="Rev.16.10" />
<verse sID="Rev.16.11" osisID="Rev.16.11" n="11" />and blasphemed the God of heaven, because of their pains and because of their sores; yet they did not repent of what they had done.
<verse eID="Rev.16.11" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rev.16.12" osisID="Rev.16.12" n="12" />Then the sixth angel emptied his bowl on the great river Euphrates; and the water in the river was dried up, so that the road for the kings of the East might be made ready.
<verse eID="Rev.16.12" />
<verse sID="Rev.16.13" osisID="Rev.16.13" n="13" />And I saw three foul spirits, like frogs, come from the mouth of the Dragon and from the mouth of the Beast and from the mouth of the false prophet.

<!-- s --><title>Doom of the Enemies of Christ</title>
<p>
<verse sID="Rev.17.1" osisID="Rev.17.1" n="1" />Then one of the seven angels who held the seven bowls came and spoke to me. ‘Come here,’ he said, ‘and I will show you the sentence passed on that Great Harlot who is seated at the meeting of many waters,
<verse eID="Rev.17.1" />
<verse sID="Rev.17.2" osisID="Rev.17.2" n="2" />and with whom all the kings of the earth have had licentious intercourse; while all who live on the earth have been make drunk by the wine of her licentiousness.’
<verse eID="Rev.17.2" />
<verse sID="Rev.17.3" osisID="Rev.17.3" n="3" />And he bore me away in a trance to a lonely place, and I saw a woman seated on a scarlet Beast, which was covered with blasphemous names; it had seven heads and ten horns.
<verse eID="Rev.17.3" />
<verse sID="Rev.17.4" osisID="Rev.17.4" n="4" />The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and glittering with gold ornaments, precious stones, and pearls. In her hand she held a gold cup, full of idolatrous abominations, and the unclean fruits of her licentiousness;
<verse eID="Rev.17.4" />
<verse sID="Rev.17.5" osisID="Rev.17.5" n="5" />while on her forehead there was written this mystic name – ‘BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND OF ALL IDOLATROUS ABOMINATIONS ON EARTH.’
<verse eID="Rev.17.5" />
<verse sID="Rev.17.6" osisID="Rev.17.6" n="6" />And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of Christ’s people and with the blood of the martyrs for Jesus. When I saw her, I was amazed beyond measure;
<verse eID="Rev.17.6" />
<verse sID="Rev.17.7" osisID="Rev.17.7" n="7" />but the angel said to me – ‘Why were you amazed? I will tell you the mystic meaning of the vision of this woman, and of the Beast, with the seven heads and ten horns, that carries her.
<verse eID="Rev.17.7" />
<verse sID="Rev.17.8" osisID="Rev.17.8" n="8" />The Beast that you saw was, but is not, and is about to rise out of the bottomless pit, and is on its way to destruction. Those who are living on earth will be amazed – those whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world – when they see that the Beast was, but is not, and yet will come.’
<verse eID="Rev.17.8" />
<verse sID="Rev.17.9" osisID="Rev.17.9" n="9" />(Here there is need for the discerning mind.) The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated.

<verse sID="Rev.17.10" osisID="Rev.17.10" n="10" />They are also seven kings; of whom five have fallen and one remains, while one is not yet come. When he comes, he must stay for a little while.
<verse eID="Rev.17.10" />
<verse sID="Rev.17.11" osisID="Rev.17.11" n="11" />So must the Beast that was, but is not. He counts as an eighth king, although he is one of the seven, and is on his way to destruction.
<verse eID="Rev.17.11" />
<verse sID="Rev.17.12" osisID="Rev.17.12" n="12" />The ten horns that you saw are ten kings, who have not yet received their kingdoms, but for an hour they receive the authority of kings, together with the Beast.
<verse eID="Rev.17.12" />
<verse sID="Rev.17.13" osisID="Rev.17.13" n="13" />These kings are of one mind in surrendering their power and authority to the Beast.

<verse sID="Rev.17.14" osisID="Rev.17.14" n="14" />They will fight with the Lamb, but the Lamb will conquer them, for he is Lord of lords and King of kings; so, too, will those with him who have received the call and are chosen and faithful.
<verse eID="Rev.17.14" />
<verse sID="Rev.17.15" osisID="Rev.17.15" n="15" />And the angel said to me – ‘The waters that you saw, where the Harlot is seated, are throngs of people and men of all nations and languages.

<verse sID="Rev.18.17" osisID="Rev.18.17" n="17" />In a single hour your vast wealth vanished.” Every ship’s captain and all who sail to any port, and sailors, and all who get their living from the sea, stood at a distance,

<verse eID="Rev.18.18" />
<verse sID="Rev.18.19" osisID="Rev.18.19" n="19" />They threw dust on their heads, and, as they wept and wailed, they cried – “Alas! Alas! Great city! All who have ships on the sea grew rich through her magnificence. In a single hour it has vanished.”

<verse eID="Rev.19.1" />
<verse sID="Rev.19.2" osisID="Rev.19.2" n="2" />for true and righteous are his judgments. For he has passed judgment on the Great Harlot who was corrupting the earth by her licentiousness, and he has taken vengeance on her for the blood of his servants.’ <verse eID="Rev.19.2" /></l>

<verse sID="Rev.19.3" osisID="Rev.19.3" n="3" />Again they cried – ‘Hallelujah!’ And the smoke from her ruins rises for ever and ever.
<verse eID="Rev.19.3" />
<verse sID="Rev.19.4" osisID="Rev.19.4" n="4" />Then the twenty-four elders and the Four creatures prostrated themselves and worshiped God who was seated on the throne, crying – ‘Amen, Hallelujah!’;
<verse eID="Rev.19.4" />
<verse sID="Rev.19.5" osisID="Rev.19.5" n="5" />and from the throne there came a voice which said –

<p type="x-noindent">
<verse sID="Rev.19.9" osisID="Rev.19.9" n="9" />Then a voice said to me ‘Write – “Blessed are those who have been summoned to the marriage feast of the Lamb.”’ And the voice said – ‘These words of God are true.’
<verse eID="Rev.19.9" />
<verse sID="Rev.19.10" osisID="Rev.19.10" n="10" />I prostrated myself at the feet of him who spoke to worship him, but he said to me – ‘No! I am your fellow servant, and the fellow servant of your brothers and sisters who bear their testimony to Jesus. Worship God. For to bear testimony to Jesus needs the inspiration of the prophets.’
<verse eID="Rev.19.10" />
<verse sID="Rev.19.11" osisID="Rev.19.11" n="11" />Then I saw that heaven lay open. There appears a white horse; its rider is called ‘Faithful’ and ‘True’; righteously does he judge and make war.
<verse eID="Rev.19.11" />
<verse sID="Rev.19.12" osisID="Rev.19.12" n="12" />His eyes are flaming fires; on his head there are many diadems, and he bears a name, written, which no one knows but himself;
<verse eID="Rev.19.12" />
<verse sID="Rev.19.13" osisID="Rev.19.13" n="13" />he has been clothed in a garment sprinkled with blood; and the name by which he is called is ‘The Word of God.’

<verse eID="Rev.19.14" />
<verse sID="Rev.19.15" osisID="Rev.19.15" n="15" />From his mouth comes a sharp sword, with which to smite the nations; and he will rule them with an iron rod. He treads the grapes in the press of the maddening wine of the wrath of Almighty God;
<verse eID="Rev.19.15" />
<verse sID="Rev.19.16" osisID="Rev.19.16" n="16" />and on his robe and on his thigh he has this name written – ‘KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.’
<verse eID="Rev.19.16" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rev.19.17" osisID="Rev.19.17" n="17" />Then I saw an angel standing on the sun. He cried in a loud voice to all the birds that fly in mid-heaven – ‘Gather and come to the great feast of God,
<verse eID="Rev.19.17" />
<verse sID="Rev.19.18" osisID="Rev.19.18" n="18" />to eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of commanders, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all free and enslaved, and of high and low.’
<verse eID="Rev.19.18" />
<verse sID="Rev.19.19" osisID="Rev.19.19" n="19" />Then I saw the Beast and the kings of the earth and their armies, gathered together to fight with him who sat on the horse and with his army.
<verse eID="Rev.19.19" />
<verse sID="Rev.19.20" osisID="Rev.19.20" n="20" />The Beast was captured, and with him was taken the false prophet, who performed the marvels before the eyes of the Beast, with which he deceived those who had received the brand of the Beast and those who worshiped his image. Alive, they were thrown, both of them, into the lake of fire – of burning sulfur.
<verse eID="Rev.19.20" />
<verse sID="Rev.19.21" osisID="Rev.19.21" n="21" />The rest were killed by the sword which came out of the mouth of him who rode on the horse; and all the birds fed on their flesh.

<p>
<chapter sID="Rev.20" osisID="Rev.20" n="20" />
<verse sID="Rev.20.1" osisID="Rev.20.1" n="1" />Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, with the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.
<verse eID="Rev.20.1" />
<verse sID="Rev.20.2" osisID="Rev.20.2" n="2" />He seized the Dragon, the primeval snake (who is the ‘devil’ or ‘Satan’), and bound him in chains for a thousand years.
<verse eID="Rev.20.2" />
<verse sID="Rev.20.3" osisID="Rev.20.3" n="3" />He flung him into the bottomless pit and locked it, and set his seal on it; that he should not deceive the nations any more, until the thousand years were ended. After that he must be let loose for a while.
<verse eID="Rev.20.3" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rev.20.4" osisID="Rev.20.4" n="4" />Then I saw thrones, and to those who took their seats on them authority was given to act as judges. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of the testimony to Jesus and because of the message of God, for they had refused to worship the Beast or its image, and had not received the brand on their foreheads and on their hands. They were restored to life, and they reigned with the Christ for a thousand years.
<verse eID="Rev.20.4" />
<verse sID="Rev.20.5" osisID="Rev.20.5" n="5" />(The rest of the dead were not restored to life until the thousand years were ended.) This is the first resurrection.
<verse eID="Rev.20.5" />
<verse sID="Rev.20.6" osisID="Rev.20.6" n="6" />Blessed and holy will he be who shares in that first resurrection. The second Death has no power over them; but they will be priests of God, and the Christ, and they will reign with him for the thousand years.
<verse eID="Rev.20.6" />
</p>

<verse eID="Rev.20.7" />
<verse sID="Rev.20.8" osisID="Rev.20.8" n="8" />and he will come out to deceive the nations that live in the four corners of the earth – Gog and Magog. He will come to gather them together for battle; and their number will be as great as the sand on the sea-shore.
<verse eID="Rev.20.8" />
<verse sID="Rev.20.9" osisID="Rev.20.9" n="9" />They went up over the breadth of the whole earth, and surrounded the camp of Christ’s people and the city that he loves. Then fire fell from the heavens and consumed them;
<verse eID="Rev.20.9" />
<verse sID="Rev.20.10" osisID="Rev.20.10" n="10" />and the devil, their deceiver, was hurled into the lake of fire and sulfur, where the Beast and the false prophet already were, and they will be tortured day and night for ever and ever.
<verse eID="Rev.20.10" />
</p>
<p>
<verse sID="Rev.20.11" osisID="Rev.20.11" n="11" />Then I saw a great white throne, and him who was seated on it. The earth and the heavens fled from his presence; no place was left for them.
<verse eID="Rev.20.11" />
<verse sID="Rev.20.12" osisID="Rev.20.12" n="12" />And I saw the dead, high and low, standing before the throne; and books were opened. Then another book was opened, the book of life; and the dead were judged, according to their actions, by what was written in the books.
<verse eID="Rev.20.12" />
<verse sID="Rev.20.13" osisID="Rev.20.13" n="13" />The sea gave up its dead, and Death and Hades gave up their dead; and they were judged, one by one, each according to his actions.
<verse eID="Rev.20.13" />
<verse sID="Rev.20.14" osisID="Rev.20.14" n="14" />Then Death and Hades were hurled into the lake of fire. This is the Second Death – the lake of fire;
<verse eID="Rev.20.14" />
<verse sID="Rev.20.15" osisID="Rev.20.15" n="15" />and all whose names were not found written in the book of life were hurled into the lake of fire.

<verse eID="Rev.21.1" />
<verse sID="Rev.21.2" osisID="Rev.21.2" n="2" />And I saw the Holy City, Jerusalem, descending new out of heaven from God, like a bride adorned in readiness for her husband.
<verse eID="Rev.21.2" />
<verse sID="Rev.21.3" osisID="Rev.21.3" n="3" />And I heard a loud voice from the throne, which said – ‘See! The tent of God is set up among people. God will live among them, and they will be his Peoples, and God himself will be among them,

<verse sID="Rev.21.4" osisID="Rev.21.4" n="4" />and he will wipe away all tears from their eyes. There will be no more death, nor will there be any more grief or crying or pain. The old order has passed away.’
<verse eID="Rev.21.4" />
<verse sID="Rev.21.5" osisID="Rev.21.5" n="5" />And he who was seated on the throne said – ‘See, I make all things new!’ And he said – ‘Write this, for these words may be trusted and are true.’
<verse eID="Rev.21.5" />
<verse sID="Rev.21.6" osisID="Rev.21.6" n="6" />And he said to me – ‘They are fulfilled. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the End. To those who thirst I will give of the spring of the water of life, freely.

<verse sID="Rev.21.7" osisID="Rev.21.7" n="7" />Those who conquer will enter into possession of these things, and I will be their God, and they will be my children.

<p>
<verse sID="Rev.21.9" osisID="Rev.21.9" n="9" />Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls, and were laden with the seven last curses, came and spoke to me. ‘Come here,’ he said, ‘and I will show you the Bride, the Wife of the Lamb.’
<verse eID="Rev.21.9" />
<verse sID="Rev.21.10" osisID="Rev.21.10" n="10" />He carried me away in a trance to a great high mountain, and showed me Jerusalem, the Holy City, descending out of heaven from God, filled with the glory of God.
<verse eID="Rev.21.10" />
<verse sID="Rev.21.11" osisID="Rev.21.11" n="11" />Its brilliance was like a precious stone, like a jasper, transparent as crystal.
<verse eID="Rev.21.11" />
<verse sID="Rev.21.12" osisID="Rev.21.12" n="12" />It had a great high wall, in which were twelve gates; and at these gates there were twelve angels, and there were names inscribed on the gates, the names of the twelve tribes of the Israelites.
<verse eID="Rev.21.12" />
<verse sID="Rev.21.13" osisID="Rev.21.13" n="13" />There were three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west.

<verse sID="Rev.21.15" osisID="Rev.21.15" n="15" />And the angel who was speaking to me had as a measure a gold rod, with which to measure the city and its gates and its wall.
<verse eID="Rev.21.15" />
<verse sID="Rev.21.16" osisID="Rev.21.16" n="16" />The city is square; the length and the breadth are the same. The angel measured with his rod; it was twelve hundred miles; its length, and breadth, and height are equal.
<verse eID="Rev.21.16" />
<verse sID="Rev.21.17" osisID="Rev.21.17" n="17" />Then he measured the wall; it was two hundred and eighty-eight feet, as people measure, that is as the angel measured.
